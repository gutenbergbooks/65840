<p><i>This year, in order to decrease the bulk of the Report, the Committee

<h2 id="GENERAL_REMARKS">GENERAL REMARKS.</h2>

<p>Our thanks are again due to the numerous Reporters, whose
names are given under the "Diaries" of the two coasts.</p>

<p>Additions to our List of Stations are Fidra in the Firth of
Forth, and also very shortly after this will be added a light-vessel
off the Carr Rock, coast of Fife, holding an intermediate
position between Bell Rock and Isle of May; and on the west
coast the light upon Ailsa Craig. It is intended to introduce
the electric light at Isle of May, and machinery and works are
at present in course of erection.</p>

<p>We regret to learn that an order has been issued that lighthouse
keepers shall no longer be allowed to read or write in
the lantern-rooms; and we are glad that some little notice has
been taken of the fact in the House of Commons on the 12th
April 1886.</p>

<p>The 1885 schedules show distinctly the compressed nature of
the migration, which, while very considerable in numerical importance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">- 6 -</span>
was, at the same time, short, sharp, and decisive. The
principal spring rush was similar, occupying only a few days at
the comparatively late date of the beginning of May, particulars
of which can be gleaned directly from the Diaries of the
stations, and especially under <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>, Fieldfares being unusually
plentiful. This appears to have been the heaviest
movement, taking all species together, but <i>Saxicolin&aelig;</i> travelled
all April and May, and <i>Silviin&aelig;</i> about the middle of April.</p>

<p>Shortly, we may describe the migration of 1885 thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>In spring of 1885 the rush was pronounced, somewhat late,
compressed, and in many respects very similar, but not so extensive
as 1884. The prevailing winds were easterly and southeasterly
in April and May, and had been very continuous.
The effect was the compression spoken of&mdash;a closed fan. The
largest migration ever witnessed at the Isle of May was on 3d
May 1885.</p>

<p>In autumn the rushes partook of a similar nature,&mdash;short,
sharp, and decisive, but very considerable in numerical importance.
Previous to middle of October, migration was very
slight at any stations, but great rushes took place between then
and about the middle of November. An interesting note of the
cross-migration of Woodcocks, and other birds, is given at the
Isle of May. Woodcocks travelling towards the N.W., and
striking the S.E. side of the glass, whilst other species were
flying S.E., and striking on exactly the opposite side of the
lantern, both flights being equally favourable, or nearly so, by
the light E. wind. Another N.W. to S.E. rush took place
during the day-time, of what must have been a very extensive
migration, upon the 10th November; wind light south, and birds
flying high. An unprecedentedly high gale as coming from
the S.E. is recorded at Isle of May on the 23d.</p>

<p>We would like to ask our readers, and the British Association,
of which we are a Committee, to recognise that the more
we know about migration, apparently the less reason is there
for scientists to use the term "Accidental." At present "Abnormal"
is better. "<i>Of accidental occurrence</i>" is a term or
phrase which ought to be <i>expunged</i>, root and branch, from
scientific records of migration. Every year's statistics prove
this more and more fully. "Probably an escape" is, no doubt,
a safeguard against undue admission to the British List; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">- 7 -</span>
we think it possible to carry this phrase too commonly into
use, ignoring the fact that migration may account <i>much more
simply</i> for such occurrences, under certain conditions, than
escapes. A list of localities where foreign fowls, like <i>Porphyrio
melanotus</i>, are kept throughout the United Kingdom, would
greatly facilitate positive records of "occurrences;" and all
such species as Canada Geese and ornamental Waterfowl, which
are kept in confinement or partial domestication, might be
returned to the Committee, or to the Association, by the proprietors,
if they were asked to do so by circular.</p>

<p>From every succeeding year's statistics, we have come almost
to similar conclusions regarding the lines of flight. Three
salient routes on to our East Coast of Scotland are invariably
shown, <i>viz.</i>: (<i>1st</i>) <i>vi&acirc;</i> the entrance of the Firth of Forth, and
as far north as Bell Rock, both coming in autumn and leaving
in spring; (<i>2d</i>) <i>vi&acirc;</i> the Pentland Firth and Pentland Skerries,
both in spring and autumn; and (<i>3d</i>) <i>vi&acirc;</i> the insular groups
of Orkney and Shetland, which perhaps may be looked upon as
part of No. 2; and a fourth with almost certainty passes into
the Moray Firth, but avoids the high cliffs of the east coast of
Aberdeenshire.</p>

<p>On the other hand, three great areas of coast-line, including
both favourably placed and favourably lighted stations, almost
invariably, save in occasionally protracted easterly winds, and
even then but rarely, send in no returns or schedules of the
very scantiest description. These areas are Berwickshire, the
whole E. coast south of the Moray Firth, and Caithness and E.
Sutherland. Each and all of these areas possess high and precipitous
coast-lines, if we except the minor estuaries of the
rivers of Tay and Dee, and a small portion of lower coast-line
in Sutherland, which face towards the east. Nevertheless these
areas partake to a very large extent of the numbers of migrants
which visit Scotland. Nowhere in Scotland, perhaps, is summer
bird-life more abundant than in, at least, the two more southern
of these areas&mdash;Berwickshire, and the interior of Aberdeen and
Banff, and the valley of Spey and its tributaries. The question
appears a natural one: by what route do these summer visitants
reach us? or, by what route do birds reach us in autumn?
Not, I believe, <i>over the high cliff edge</i> in the latter case, otherwise
<i>some</i> migration would certainly be visible from the rock-bound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">- 8 -</span>
stations. As shown in one case, positive assurance is
given by the reporter at Noss Head, that for eleven years
scarcely a bird "<i>had been observed on migration day or night</i>,"
and we have scarcely any statistics to show a contrary view, as
regards the said area all through our seven reports.</p>

<p>How, it is known with considerable certainty that Caithness
owes its periodical passing visits of such species as
Blackcap and Pied Flycatcher, both in spring and autumn,
to its immediate proximity to one of the chief highways of
migration&mdash;the Pentland Firth; and the configuration of the
N.E. peninsula of that county clearly points to the route by
which spring passing migrants reach the E. coast of the county,
as we have already explained in previous remarks. They
cross over a low-lying depression in the land from Dunnet
Bay, and cut off the peninsula of Canisbay. Coming again in
autumn, the same birds, to some slight extent, may return
across this peninsula, but the undoubted fact remains that the
compressed and strongest flights cross over the Pentland Skerries
and through the Firth.</p>

<p>In the same way, it appears that while scarcely a bird
is ever recorded at the stations along the E. cliff-edge of
Aberdeen, yet, in autumn, a well-marked stream of migration
enters the N.E. counties at a point westward of Troup Head,
which forms the northern abutment of the dividing ridge, or
watershed, between what are known as the Faunal areas of
"Moray and Dee;" and that thence up the wide open valley
of the Spey, and over the low-lying portions of the south coast
of the Moray Firth, this stream is clearly traceable at many
points. It is also known that an equally decided spring
"return" descends the same great valley, and enters it across
the dividing range between the head waters of Spey and Spean
or Pattack. We have studied this subject locally&mdash;at many
points personally&mdash;especially in spring, and notes we have taken,
dating back for many years, all tend to strengthen the statement.</p>

<p>In the same way it appears almost equally certain, that while
few birds fly across over the cliff-edges of Berwickshire, but
pour in vast streams up the open and wide Firth of Forth, still
Berwickshire, and the interior of the south of Scotland, are well
supplied with migrants; and the "return" is equally apparent.
A study of our previous remarks by our readers cannot, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">- 9 -</span>
think, fail to give them the idea of the process of the population
of these interior portions of the country in Scotland.</p>

<p>England is differently circumstanced to a great extent, owing
principally to its low-lying sea-board. There is no occasion
there to have the great migration waves compressed into
grooves and firths and depressions.</p>

<p>The further question naturally may be asked, "But why
should they not fly in over the cliff tops?" We think there
are already many reasons stated in our previous remarks why
such is less likely to happen, during normal migration, whether
by day or by night, and that they should avoid obstacles, and
choose an easier if not a shorter route.</p>

<p>The population of these interior parts, which are bounded by
precipitous coast-lines, appears to us almost certainly to arrive
by the innumerable veins&mdash;if I may so call them&mdash;which run
into and join the main arteries,&mdash;and thus a circular migration
is evinced.</p>

<p>Birds in normal migration against a beam wind fly low, and
on reaching low-lying sea-board pass on inland without resting.
But on approaching high land, say 200 or 300 feet in height,
while at night the greatest darkness is ahead of them, and the
greatest light to the north or south of their course; during the
day-time, if the wind is off-shore&mdash;a beam wind,&mdash;on approaching
the lee shore, they enter upon a calm belt of sheltered air
and water, and choose the easier path along shore. According
to whether the off-shore wind is strong or light, will they approach
nearer or keep further out; and, skirting the coast-line, so
enter upon one of the great open highways of normal migration.
This, which appears almost undoubted, will in great measure
account for the invariably slender returns sent in by nearly all
the rock-bound stations of the more precipitous portions of the
Scottish Coast.</p>

<p>Regarding the migration of Woodcock generally, the following
notes may prove of some interest. These I culled from the
note-books and game register of a naval friend stationed at
Corfu and the Albanian coast in 1879.</p>

<p>The first flight of Woodcock occurs about the first ten days of
November, and it remains a very short time before passing on,
unless abnormal "south winds keep them in cover." The
second and heavy flight occurs about the middle of December,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">- 10 -</span>
and may remain a mouth, and odd birds are shot even in February
in the lower covers. Thomas Wood, Esq., British Consul at
Patras,&mdash;an authority for the locality,&mdash;says that Woodcock
come in November with a N.W. wind most freely, but in
December with a N.E. wind.</p>

<p>By a study of the area over which the Woodcock breeds, of
the time they take in flight, and of a comparison of the dates
of arrivals at Heligoland and East British Coasts with the
above,&mdash;it seems pretty clear, I think, that the early flight,
which extends along the whole Albanian coast is composed
entirely of birds bred amongst the higher levels of their southern
range, coming probably from the Carpathians and as far south
as the Balkans, as well as from high localities even nearer to
the Albanian coast and coverts. It seems to us also equally
clear that the December flight, preferring the beam wind from
the N.E., comes from the western parts of North Europe, having
originally started from the breeding areas of the extreme north.
On starting, we will say, from the N. of Scandinavia, or Scandinavia,
and other parts of the breeding range, they arrive on
our coasts about October {our first flight). This corresponds
with the first flight on the Albanian coast a month later. Birds
reaching us congregate upon our islands under the genial influence
of the Gulf Stream, but may finally be drawn off by
December, and constitute a portion at least of the great flight
at Corfu, where one ship's sportsmen have been known to kill
something like 300 cock in a day or two (I have not the figures,
but they are accessible, if necessary).</p>

<p>Regarding the subject of the arrival of young' birds in advance
of the adults in autumn, the Committee, we think, should look
at the movements exhibited by, and distinctly observable in,
certain species. Those, perhaps, most easily observed are the
larger Natatores, such as Geese and Swans and Gannets, whose
distinct movements can be watched year after year, and recorded
with almost absolute certainty. We do not intend to dilate
upon the importance of this method at present, but in the connection
will merely quote a significant passage from Mr Robert
Gray's "Birds of the West of Scotland,"<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and to supplement it
by saying that there can be no doubt as to the accuracy of the
observations made, as they are well known to the inhabitants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">- 11 -</span>
Mr Gray says: "Previous to leaving, the Barnacle Geese
assemble in immense flocks on the open sands, at low tide, in
the Sounds of Benbecula and S. Uist; and as soon as one
detachment is on the wing, it is seen to be guided by a leader,
who points the way with strong flight northwards, maintaining
a noisy bearing until he gets the flock into the right course. After
an hour's interval, he is seen returning with noisy gabble alone,
southwards to the main body, and taking off another detachment
as before, until the whole are gone. A notice of this singular
habit was first communicated to me by Mr Alex. Carmichael,
and has since been corroborated by Mr Norman M'Donald, who
informs me that the inhabitants of the Long Island have been
long familiar with it."</p>

<p>The usual schedules were sent to twenty-seven stations.
Thirteen stations on the East Coast of Scotland have returned
forty-eight schedules. Isle of May gives heaviest returns with
nineteen schedules. Pentland Skerries follows with eleven.
Bell Rock again is next in importance.</p>

<p>In the List of Stations we follow the same plan as in that of
1884, but we add in several cases the names of the assistant
light-keepers whose names have been returned as taking interest
in the proceedings. The present year's returns will be indicated
by asterisks.</p>

<p>We do not repeat the explanation of migration values of the
the stations here for the Scotch Coast, that being done in our
last Report (<i>q.v.</i> p. 10).</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Diary from the Stations.</span></h4>

<p><i>N. Unst.</i>&mdash;John Nichol (principal), J. J. Morrison, Robert
Agnew, and John Down (assistants), send in three well-filled
schedules. J. N. in a note says: "Wood's Natural History,
second edition, would be very useful to us here." Amongst
rarities, a <a href="#Wryneck">Wryneck</a>, obtained on 9th September (see under
species). "About 5th September all Puffins, Marrots, Kittiwakes,
and Guillemots disappeared. Puffins and Mosscheepers
(probably Rock Pipits, J. A. H. B.) breed on the rock, and a
Gull or two. Falcon Hawk on the island ashore, and visits the
rock in search of small birds. No Swans seen as in former
years in November and December. I was told a great flock was
seen at Lerwick going north early in November. Since my
arrival at this station in July last from Dhuheartach, not a
single Eider Duck was seen. Only birds we see now are from
the shore (December 26, 1885), <i>viz.</i>, Starlings, Sparrow Hawks,
Crows; a few Gulls flying about; Solan Geese all away."&mdash;Signed J. N.</p>

<p><i>Sumburgh Head.</i>&mdash;James Youngclause (principal), Robert
Gifford (assistant). During the summer a great number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">- 14 -</span>
Gulls breed in the cliffs. Also large numbers of Guillemots,
Razorbills, which arrive first and second week of August. Also
lots of Starlings and Grey Linnets, but these and the Gulls
remain the whole year. Under date of 16th January 1886,
Mr Y. writes: "Birds have been very scarce; not one stranger
since the 27th November." Two schedules.</p>

<p><i>North Ronaldshay.</i>&mdash;John Tulloch (principal). Two schedules.
Gannets began flying north about the 18th April.</p>

<p><i>Auskerry.</i>&mdash;John M'Donald (principal). Three well-filled
schedules.</p>

<p><i>Pentland Skerries.</i>&mdash;Signed by John Gilmour (assistant).
Eleven very full schedules. Mr Gibson (principal), Mr Frazer,
and Mr M'Gee are all much interested in the subject. They
have been supplied with a copy of C. A. Johns' "British Birds in
their Haunts," published by the Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge. Harvie-Brown visited Pentland Skerries in July
1885. "Skerries" is a misnomer for the larger island. It is a
lovely island, richly grassed, feeds twenty sheep on 114 acres;
very level, fine turf, rich in daisies and buttercups, producing
lovely milk, and admirably situated to intercept migration.
Elsewhere an account of the birds seen there in summer will be
incorporated.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Pentland Skerries, along with Isle of May, as
usual, shared the heaviest rushes and returns, and Bell Rock
very fully participated. The rush seemed to be about the
middle of October, continuing, but not so heavily, through that
month, and increasing again up to the middle of November.
On the 11th November our reporters say: "Never saw so many
Fieldfares flying round the light" as to-night.</p>

Buckley and J. A. Harvie-Brown, in press. There can scarcely be a doubt that
this station would quickly rival the "Isle of May" in rarities, if the men had equal
facilities of obtaining specimens. If they had guns, also, they might add largely
to their stock of wholesome fresh food.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Dunnet Head.</i>&mdash;David Laidlaw (principal) sent one schedule.
Visited by H.-B. in 1885. It is easily understood why it is not
a good station, notwithstanding the favourable description of
light. The light is 346 feet above the sea, and does not face
clear to eastward except upon the horizon, a great cliff top
intercepting the downward rays at a distance of at least 100 yards
from the tower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">- 15 -</span></p>

<p><i>Holborn Head.</i>&mdash;No return. Visited by H.-B. in 1885. The
position is decidedly bad, being quite too land-locked both to
east and west. I had a long chat with Mr Charles Christian,
the second light-keeper, but did not see Mr Charleston, the
principal. Mr Christian told me that not a bird has appeared
at the lights since he came last year in May. He was at Cantick
Head, another station utterly unfrequented by birds.&mdash;(Extract
from H.-B.'s Journal.)</p>

<p><i>Noss Head.</i>&mdash;No return. Visited by H.-B. in 1885. Mr
Greig (principal) has been here eleven years, and reported that
scarcely a land-bird has ever been known to strike the dome or
light, or "been observed on migration day or night" (<i>sic</i>). Noss
Head Light lies open to the N.N.E., E.S.E., and S.S.E., and is
only 175 feet above the sea (Pentland Skerries Light is 170
feet, and Isle of May 240 feet); and no land interruptions
occur. Nevertheless, it utterly fails to attract birds, as, indeed,
do most stations with an abrupt and precipitous coast, for
reasons which we think are almost self-evident.&mdash;(See General
Remarks.)</p>

<p><i>Cromarty.</i>&mdash;Robt. S. Ritson (principal) sends one schedule.
He says: "No birds struck lantern during the year. Rather
more birds observed than in 1884. Pervading winds were again
westerly from January to April, but between May and October
easterly; but the change of wind brought no accessions of birds.
Land-locked station.</p>

<p><i>Chanonry.</i>&mdash;John M'Gill (principal) and Wm. Irvine (assistant)
send one light schedule, and the remarks: "There is no
difference from the remarks of other years. The migration this
year seems to be for the purposes of feeding. No certain
migration observable." Mr M'Gill, however, goes on to say;
"The Sand Martins, when congregated on Major M'Kenzie's
yacht-rigging from the bowsprit up to the mast, and down to
the end of the jib-boom, made a curious sight, when lying at
anchor." This was on the 24th August 1885.</p>

<p><i>Bell Rock.</i>&mdash;James Jack (principal) sends as usual carefully
and well-filled schedules, quite among the best received. Under
date of 16th October, at the time of a rush, Mr Jack has the
following general remarks: "Birds began to arrive at 7.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,
striking lightly and flying off again; unable to tell of what
species. Numbers went on increasing till midnight, when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">- 16 -</span>
seemed that a vast flock had arrived, as they now swarmed in
the rays of light, and, striking hard, fell dead on balcony, or
rebounded off and went over the rail, falling into the sea. At
3 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> another flock seemed to have arrived, as the numbers now
increased in density; at the same time, all kinds crowded on to
the lantern windows, trying to force their way to the light.
The noise they made shrieking and battering the windows, etc.,
baffles description. The birds were now apparently in thousands.
Nothing ever seen here like it by us keepers. Wherever there
was a light visible in the building, they tried to force their
way to it. The bedroom windows being open as usual for
air all night, they got in there and put the bedroom light out.
All birds went off at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, going W.S.W. Redwings were most
in numbers; Starlings came next. Blackbirds, Fieldfares, and
Larks." The later rush in November seems to have taken place
entirely at night also: "No birds were seen throughout the daylight
of the 11th and 12th November, and the movement ceased
at midnight of the 12th," when the wind became strong from
S.W. All birds visiting here between October 18 till December
12 were composed of both old and young, also male and female;
but young birds most in number. Many hundreds lost their
lives.</p>

<p><i>Inchkeith.</i>&mdash;Robt. Grierson sends a schedule with the following
diary: "During the night of the 5th September a small
flock of birds was observed hovering around the lantern at 11
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, wind W., light breeze and haze, and two young Stonechats
were caught." At midnight, also, two more; and other small
movements are given.</p>

<p><i>Fidra.</i>&mdash;William Ross. Arrival of the Solan Geese noted
on March 27; also Eider Ducks. Mr Ross sends two well-filled
schedules, but is disappointed with the results. He need not
we think, as Fidra lies somewhat land-locked and out of the
stream. We are much obliged to him for the first Schedules
from the new Firth of Forth Station. Mr Ross writes under
date of July 24: "Solan Geese, Gulls, and all sea birds have
deserted our island entirely. About a dozen sparrows are now
our only feathered visitors;" and on Aug. 4th&mdash;"Having been
on the mainland, I was quite surprised to see the numerous and
varied flocks of many kinds of birds, not one of which came
near our island."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">- 17 -</span></p>

<p><i>Isle of May.</i>&mdash;J. Agnew (principal), Messrs Young and
Anderson (assistants), send twenty full schedules, indicating a
very heavy migration, past this favoured isle. At present a
staff of men are busy putting in electric light machinery here.
It will be curious to watch the result next season.</p>

<p>New occurrences continually turn up at Isle of May, and this
year we have to record amongst rarities and acquisitions the
Common Dotterel (<i>Endromias morinellus</i>, L.), the Red Backed
Shrike (<i>Lanius collurio</i>), and Ortolan Bunting (<i>Emberiza hortulana</i>)&mdash;two
specimens obtained. Also Turtle Dove (<i>Columba
turtur</i>, L.)&mdash;one shot; and the Dipper was obtained for the first
time, though it had been seen before, as stated in previous
reports. It proved to be the British form. Specimens of these
are added to the collection at Isle of May. We gave earlier
notice of the first three above enumerated, in the <i>Proceedings
of the Royal Physical Society</i>, Edinburgh, as we belong to
that class of naturalists who do not believe in withholding facts
until they become rusty. To do so may be useful for selfish
motives and personal <i>kudos</i>, but is not calculated to promote
further study, and is, indeed, calculated to delay it.</p>

<p>Continuous E. winds at the beginning of May caused a vast
rush on 2d to 4th May of many species. Mr Agnew writes:
"The long tact of S.E. wind has brought an extraordinary
'rush' of birds to the island yesterday (on the 3d) and to-day;
the night of the 2d, and all day of the 3d, was constant rain
and fog. For a day or two previous to the 3d, we had a few
birds, and some strangers; but they were only the heralds of
the great army. I have seen something like it in the 'fall,' but
never in the spring. These last two days we have 'birds;
birds everywhere.' I think I have identified them all, except
the three mentioned inside. If you had been here to-day,
what a bag you would have made."&mdash;Signed J. A., 4th May
1885.</p>

<p>In the schedule Mr Agnew says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"3d May.&mdash;An extraordinary rush of migrants to-day; never
seen anything like it in spring. To attempt to give numbers is
simply useless. I will just give you the names in succession.
I can't spare a line for each.&mdash;Fieldfares, Redwings, Ring Ouzels,
Blackbirds, Lapwings, Dotterels, Rock Pigeons, Hawk, Meadow
Pipits, Redstarts, Whinchats, Tree Sparrows, Yellow Wagtails,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">- 18 -</span>
Ortolan Bunting (obtained), Robins, Chiff-Chaffs, Wood Warbler,
Black Cap Warbler, Marsh Tit, Whitethroats, and Pied Flycatchers."
And on 4th still increased in numbers, but wind
shifted this morning to E. from S.E.</p>

<p>Mr Agnew mentions also "a bird" he has "often reported,"
a "grey bird with a white feather each side of the tail, and
larger than a pipit, kind of slate colour, light streak through
eye, black hood over its head." And another; "colour of Tree
Sparrow, but smaller grey white belly, slate-coloured head;
never seen the latter before."</p>

<p>In autumn Mr Agnew says: "Up to 14th October migration
was very meagre,&mdash;something like last year, and from
the same cause; gales of wind from the W. and N.E. That
we have any at all shows how determined the birds are to
keep their usual time of migration, even when under great difficulties."</p>

<p>Under date of Oct. 17th&mdash;"A great rush of migrants at Isle
of May "&mdash;Mr Agnew has the remarks: "The Woodcock was
killed on the S.E. side, and the other birds on the N.W. side.
Thus the migrants have been exactly meeting one another;
and this is just as I would have expected,&mdash;the Woodcocks
<i>coming</i> to us, and the others <i>leaving</i> us. It would appear as if
they were all waiting a favourable opportunity to go. Seventeen
Woodcocks were shot during the day on the 17th Oct. on
Isle of May."&mdash;J. A. The birds striking the N.W. side consisted
of Redwings, Larks, Starlings, Blackbirds, Chaffinches,
Whinchats, Chiff-Chaffs, Willow Warblers, Golden Crests, one
Crow, and the rush continued over the 18th. These birds,
striking the N.W. side, no doubt reached our shores further
north, and were "coasting," or, as we have remarked in previous
reports (as in the case of Woodpigeons and Larks), were crossing
the Firth of Forth from north-westerly directions to southeasterly
ones. The wind at the time of this migration was light
E. The Woodcock would thus travel at fair advantage, and
strike the S.E. side; and the other birds which struck the N.W.
would have a still more favourable flight, with the wind <i>beam
on the left shoulders</i>.</p>

<p>We consider these remarks by Mr Agnew most valuable, as
bearing out previous experience in a remarkable manner.</p>

<p>Again, under date of 10th Nov., Mr Agnew writes: "Thousands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">- 19 -</span>
of Fieldfares, etc., etc. The vast rush to-day were flying
exactly in the same direction as the great rush of the 17th
Oct., and had it been at night, the lantern would have been
swarming, and they would have struck it exactly on the N.W.
side as before; wind S., but very nearly calm. The birds were
flying high in the air; a few lighted, but immediately went on
again direct S.E. I never saw anything like it in daylight
before. There were also blackbirds, male and female, on the
island to-day, but the males predominating."</p>

<p>Again, on the 26th Nov., Mr Agnew writes: "10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, S.E.
gale. Two Woodcocks shot. This gale came on at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on
the 23d, and is still increasing, and the glass falling. It is now
4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and the glass 29&middot;05. There has been nothing like this
from the S.E. for years. The barometer fell to 28&middot;65 on the
night of the 26th."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Separate Report under Genera and Species.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>Spring.</i>&mdash;In February indication of Fieldfares on
23d and 26th, and with S.W. gale at Isle of May on 22d,
23d, and 27th, an unusual experience here to appear so
frequently as they have done. A few also appeared 2d, 3d,
4th, and a good many on 9th, with N.W. winds. Again a few
March 15th, 18th, and 24th at Isle of May. In April, only one
record. Isle of May; but in May, flocks and stragglers for first
three weeks at Pentland Skerries; prevailing winds, N.E.;
no very strongly defined "rush," only on one day, flocks at
Isle of May. A few unimportant movements of other <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>,
<i>viz.</i>, Song Thrush, Redwing at Stations VII., VIII., XIV., and
XXVII. The Ring Ouzel is noted at Pentland Skerries, but
marked as "very rare here" (20th April), and again May 2d
and onwards for several days.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;An early movement of Song Thrushes, July 4th
and 17th, at Pentland Skerries; wind variable on 4th, and light
N.W. on 17th, and one bird at Isle of May on 27th. Unimportant
again at Isle of May in Aug. 13th and 18th, and ditto
in September at same station. <i>First</i> Fieldfares on 29th, with
light W. wind; but in October real migration set in of <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>,
earliest as usual at Isle of May; on 8th a Fieldfare (wind
shifting from N. to S.W.) followed by a single bird. First<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">- 20 -</span>
record of Redwing again at Pentland Skerries, with light N.N.E.
airs, an apparent rush of which at same place between 26th and
31st. Flocks and intermittent movements all the month from
8th to end, of all three species. November, however, bulks
largest from Stations IV,, VII., VIII., IX., X., XIV., XV., and
XXVII., during the whole month. Fieldfares predominating far
beyond the numbers of other <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>. Whilst many "flocks"
are recorded all through the schedules south of VIII. (N. Ronaldshay)
to XIV. (Pentland Skerries), and even appearances at
XV, (Dunnet Head), fewer records are given north of VIII.,
and none occur between XV. and XXVII. (Isle of May). A
rush is only very decidedly shown at Isle of May on 10th,
when thousands of Fieldfares and other Thrushes round station
at 9.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, with a S. wind, and flew on southwards. On the
17th there is a "rush" recorded of Redwings at XXVII.
at 1 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, light E. haze&mdash;six killed. Immense numbers of the
several species of <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>,&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, Fieldfares, Song Thrushes,
Redwings, but curiously we do not find a single entry of Blackbirds
anywhere during the whole Autumn Migration, which
extended all through December and January, though in smaller
numbers as compared with November. Prevailing wind all
October, northerly and easterly; south-easterly and easterly in
November, but the rush came with due S. wind. When westerly
winds occurred, as usual fewer records. In December, winds
various, but more westerly than November, but in January again
back to E.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> <i>Addition to List of Birds of the Isle of May.</i>&mdash;Dipper (<i>Cinclus aquaticus</i>, L.),

at Isle of May, under curatorship of Mr J. Agnew.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxicolin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>Spring</i>, confined to April and May. Records
from VIII. (North Ronaldshay), XIV. (Pentland Skerries), and
XXVII. (Isle of May) of Wheatears, Whinchats, and Redstarts.
The "Stonechats" of the N. Ronaldshay Schedule are probably
Wheatears, a rush of which took place there on April 4th&mdash;the
earliest record&mdash;at twelve noon; wind light south. Wheatears
arrived pretty numerously at XXVI I. , to breed there, on 20th
April. Earliest Redstart at XIV., with strong S.S.E. wind and
fog, marked "rare," on 29th April; but earliest at XXVII.
on the 18th, one [male], light west, and haze. Towards the end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">- 21 -</span>
May Redstarts appeared in very small numbers; again at
XIV., and two Whinchats.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Early departure of the old Wheatears from
XXVII. (Isle of May), before 22d July. This is noted as
earlier than usual by Mr Agnew. One bird noted at XIV.
(Pentland Skerries) on 23d August, with N.N.E. and driving
rain.</p>

<p>Earliest southward movement of Redstart at XIV. on 14th
August&mdash;a single bird&mdash;wind N.W.; seen on island. At IV.
(N. Unst) a "rush" of Redstarts and Wheatears at night, wind
light S.W., on 9th September. At XXVII. a few old males on
18th September, followed by mixed old and young on following
day. Redstarts at IV. on 3d October, and a rush of Whinchats
at Isle of May at 1 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>&mdash;wind S.E., haze. Single record of
Whinchat in November at XXVII., and "Stonechats" at
XXVIII. B. The new station of Fidra, in the Firth of Forth,
a single bird. On 22d July most of the old Wheatears had left
Isle of May&mdash;"an early date for them to leave."&mdash;J. A.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silviin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>In Spring</i>, earliest Robin record on 13th and 17th
February at XXVII. (Isle of May)&mdash;"the first for a long time."
Latest spring record, also at XXVII., on 15th May. Most seen
on 13th April, at XXVII., N.N.E.; and several all day on
XIV. (Pentland Skerries), strong S.E., on 8th April. Cromarty
sends one return of Robin on 2d May. <i>Willow Warbler</i>&mdash;earliest,
29th April, at Isle of May; and Wood Warbler at
same place on 2d May, with strong S.E., fog and rain. <i>Whitethroat</i>
at Isle of May, with light S. and S.E., between 13th
and 24th&mdash;an indication of a rush lighting on S.E. side of lantern,
with light N.W., and rain on 24th.</p>

<p><i>Autumn.</i>&mdash;Species observed were Robin and Whitethroat;
Robin most prevalent, Whitethroat next. Earliest Robin at
N. Unst, 26th July; latest, 28th November, at I. of Fidra
(but as this might only be local, take latest at Dunnet on 14th,
or Isle of May on 12th). If any rush noticeable, about the 17th
September.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phylloscopin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Gold Crests are recorded in April 12th
and 13th, and 20th and 23d at XXVII.; few on the two first
dates, rush on the last, with W.S.W., and fog and drizzling
rain. No other records from any part of E. Coast in any
spring month. Wood Warblers, 8th to 24th May; a "great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">- 22 -</span>
rush" all night on the 9th, with snow and hail showers, and
wind N.W. to N.E.; and again all night on 18th, with rain,
hail, and snow from N.E. [We can remember, on the 10th
May, snow lay on the banks of Spey two inches deep at Aberlour.&mdash;J. A. H. B.]
Two Chiff-Chaffs are also noted on 20th.
All the above at XXVII. (Isle of May), and no other spring
records of Phylloscopin&aelig;.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Earliest Chiff-Chaff, 27th July, at XXVII.,
11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, E., light fog; and again between the 12th and 24th
August. Numbers on 13th, and number of males on 24th.
On 13th, N.W. wind, strong, clear. Also, on 15th, a <i>Willow
Warbler</i>&mdash;light haze, struck S.E. side, light W. wind; and a
<i>Wood Warbler</i> on the 24th&mdash;a fine male. In September, a
single Willow Warbler from N. Unst, light N.W., on 15th;
and a few <i>Gold Crests</i> at XXVII. on 1st, and again on 17th
and 19th&mdash;the latter amongst the rocks on the E. side&mdash;light
S.W. A rush of Chiff-Chaffs on 17th October at XXVII., light
E., haze and rain&mdash;and Willow Warbler; and then, on 18th and
19th, Gold Crests all night. Latest date of autumn migration
of Phylloscopin&aelig; is of Chiff-Chaffs, on November 4th, at
XXVII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accentorin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;The only records are in October 1885, at
XXVII., on 7th and 19th. Two or three pairs are breeding
there this summer, and of late years it has become resident,
"a good few having been here all the winter."&mdash;J. A.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acrocephalin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In September, on the 5th, between 8 and
10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, there was a rush of many species over the island of
XXVII., amongst which were Reed and Sedge Warblers striking,
also Whitethroats. [What were named with a query
"Immature Blue-Throated Warblers" turned out to be immature
Redstarts&mdash;J. A. H. B.] Of the Reed Warblers recorded,
when asked, Mr Agnew, distinguishing from the Sedge
Warbler, says: "I have your card about the Reed Warblers,
and should they appear again, I will try and procure
specimens; but there seems no doubt as to their presence
here during the rush of Warblers reported in the last
Schedule."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troglodytid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Autumn of 1884, a few still seen on Isle of
May in beginning of January 1885. Spring of 1885, one at
XXVII. (Isle of May) on 10th, and at XIV. (Pentland Skerries)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">- 23 -</span>
reported as being about the rocks there all winter.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> At VII.
(Sumburgh Head), one all day going about dykes&mdash;no doubt, a
resident of the adjoining mainland. (A "Yellow Wren," also
at same place, may be either Willow <i>Wren</i> or <i>Willow Warbler</i>,
or a Gold Crest?) This was on 31st March.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> It does not appear whether the Wren is resident in Pentland Skerries every
winter, but it was certainly so in 1884-5. (See above.)</p>

</div>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Earliest record at Pentland Skerries, September
20th, seen in garden. In October, records from N. Unst, 27th&mdash;S.W.,
light breeze (!!), clear&mdash;flying round rocks. [<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;This
record seems to us to make it very desirable that specimens of
the Common Wrens, or their feet and wings, but better the
whole birds, be sent us for examination from this Station. We
would like to see specimens, shot or otherwise, obtained in
summer, and also specimens obtained in October or during the
Autumn Migration. It might settle a very interesting question.
A little carbolic acid would preserve them quite well, if dried
after in the sun, or in the oven, or gradually in the kitchen.]
A good few records run through October, but no large numbers&mdash;at
Unst (XIV.) and XXVII.; and the same remark applies in
November. The last noted is in January 1886 at XXVII.&mdash;"a
few"&mdash;and the one before, at XIV., on 27th December, "seen
on island." It is always remarkable to observe the near proximities
of dates between occurrences at Isle of May and Pentland
Skerries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;The only month in the year, from January
to December, in which no return is made by Wagtails, is July
1885. All the entries are under "Wagtail." [<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;We would
like to receive a good many Wagtails from all Stations in every
month if possible. A little carbolic acid would preserve them.]</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> spring Wagtail is recorded at XXVII. (Isle of May) on
24th February, S.W. The last at same place on May 23d, but
the species breeds there. April is the busiest month in Wagtails.
A "rush" at N. Ronaldshay on April 4th. Next last
date is at Fidra (XXVIII. B.), flying about feeding. A record
from Dunnet Head says; "1st May.&mdash;Wagtails seen daily till
end of July; breed about the cliffs," etc. The <i>Yellow Wagtail</i>
is recorded from XXVII. on 8th May. If it had a black breast
and very long tail, its right name is "Grey Wagtail," though
yellow. If short tail, and very bright yellow, it is the true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">- 24 -</span>
<i>Yellow Wagtail, or Rays'</i>, a much rarer bird in Scotland. Was
it the same as one Mr G. E. P. and H.-B. shot on Isle of May in
October 1884?</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;"Wagtails" begin to be observed on 17th July
at XIV., and in about equal numbers in August (three dates in
each month). Increase a little in September, and show indication
of movement at XXVII. on 26th and 29th (old and young
on 26th, and mostly old on 29th), only four dates at XIV. and

and the one on 25th, "had very little white upon it."&mdash;J. Agnew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig; 2.</span>&mdash;Pipits.&mdash;First Spring Meadow Pipits at
XXVII.&mdash;a single bird; light N.E., clear on 10th March, and
"a number" on 18th; gale from W. for two days. Wind changed
to N.E. at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> In April, at XXVI. (Bell Rock), on 17th and
18th; wind S.E., fog. <i>Rock Pipits.</i>&mdash;At XXVII. (Isle of May),
an increase over residents observed on 4th April, and more
arrived to breed on 20th. Further increase on 2d May.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Meadow Pipit ("Mosscheeper") at N. Unst,

left" by 14th. A rush on 9th September of "Mosscheepers"
at IV. (N. Unst) at night; wind S.W., light haze. Also at X.
Ronaldshay "a number" of Rock Pipits arrived on 4th September,
"and remain all winter." At XXVII., old and young

place, and numbers, also including one old male, on 23d, and up
to 24th. No other records in spring.</p>

Isle of May, Curator, J. Agnew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hirundinid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>Spring.</i>&mdash;Very heavy returns of Swallows,
commencing lightly on 10th April; a few seen at N. Ronaldshay;
E.N.E., light clear; and on the 19th, at XXVII., one with
the remark, "this is early." First seen at XXVIII. B. (Fidra)
on 24th. At X. (Auskerry) "flocks remain till 14th June;"
came with S.E.S. and N.E. winds. Records numerous from X.,
XIV., XV., XIX., XXVII., and XXVIII. B. First seen at XIV.
on 14th May. No great appearance of a "rush." Seen more
or less all June at Pentland Skerries and Isle of May, but no
June records from other stations.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;5th July at XIV., and of Martins 6th to 12th
and 16th. One Swallow at Isle of May on 14th. All August
Martins and Swallows, and a "rush" of latter at XXVII. on 24th;
light W., clear. <i>Latest.</i>&mdash;One Swallow and one Martin at
XXVII. on 7th October.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fringillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Every month in the year, more or less of
different species, as follows, in order of greatest numbers: Grey
and Green Linnets in February, March, April, and again in
June; and House and Tree Sparrows in May, and odd ones of
the former during the other spring months. Chaffinches scarce,
and single records in February, March, April, May; one each
month, all at XXVII. (Isle of May). Twenty Tree Sparrows in
a flock, at XXVII., on 29th May; and daily large flock of
Sparrows at Fidra on 16th and 23d. Sparrow "rare" on XIV.,
seen April 23d.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Large flock of Heather Linties (Twites) at
Start Point all the month of July. Grey Linnets (or perhaps
these are Twites?) at XIV. (Pentland Skerries), 27th July. In
August, Sparrows at N. Unst; N.N.W., fog. Grey Linnets (or
Twites?) at XIV,, end of August; N.E. Only one record in
September at XIV.; none elsewhere, but October bulks larger.
Only stations sending any returns are XIV. and XXVII. in
October. Movement slack in first week, bulking largest 16th
and 17th. Rush of <i>Chaffinches</i>, <i>Linnets</i>, a few <i>Redpoles</i> on 14th,
and a few <i>Siskins</i> on 30th October.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">- 26 -</span></p>

<p><i>In November, up to 23d.</i>&mdash;Chaffinches at N. Unst on 3d&mdash;light
N.W., rain&mdash;and on 4th at XXVII. Green Linnets at N.
Unst on 19th November, and at VII. (Sumburgh Head) on 12th.
Numbers on 5th at XIV. all day, fresh W., clear; and also on
XXVII., same day, a few; light W., clear. Latest record of
Green Linnets, December 18th; but Grey Linnets on 18th
January 1886, and Redpoles (three) on 23d, at XXVII.</p>

<p>We have overlooked also a few stray records of "Bramblings"
on 6th and 7th April, at XXVII.; strong E. winds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emberizid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>In Spring</i>, Snow Buntings. One seen on
February 7th at XXVII., and five on 27th; a number on 20th
March at N. Ronaldshay on the island. Gale: sleet&mdash;twenty-three
struck and seven killed. In April two flying about the
rocks at Sumburgh Head on 6th&mdash;<i>the</i> latest record of the species
in spring.</p>

<p>One <i>Reed Bunting</i> at Pentland Skerries on February 27th; S.
gale and haze on island. Few records of Yellow Bunting in
February and March, and at XXVII. equally scarce. Only occasional
also in April anywhere, and same to June. <i>Common</i>
Bunting, first single bird at XIV. on 18th; odd records till June
on six dates till that time. Winds prevailing from N.E.
through E. to S.E. (very likely local movements).</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Snow Buntings returned only from XIV. and
XXVII. in October, but in November at IV., VII., VIII., X.,
XIV., XV., XXVII. all through the month, but not heavily as
compared with other years. Rush at VIII. (N. Ronaldshay),
with S.E. gale; "flocks" frequent at XIV., XV., not abundant
at XXVII. during November. In September, a few odd records
only at VII. (Sumburgh Head) and XXVII. (Isle of May). No
records later than November 28th. One record of Common
Bunting at XIV. on 13th November. No records in autumn of
any other species.</p>

<p><i>Addition to Isle of May List.</i>&mdash;Ortolan Buntings: Two specimens&mdash;one
shot 12.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>; light S.E., clear, thick fog and heavy
rain all night. Named by Mr Agnew correctly.&mdash;J. A. H. B.
Mr Agnew adds under 29th May: "There are two Ortolan
Buntings, three Tree Sparrows, and one female Redstart on the
island since the 23d April."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alaudid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>Spring Migration.</i>&mdash;In February records from
XIV. and XXVII. only; one single bird from the former on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">- 27 -</span>
14th, but a rush at the latter on 17th, at 1 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Light E., rain and
haze; three killed. Continuing in numbers on 18th, four killed
and many wounded. Curiously no records from Bell Rock on
these dates or in this month. Likely the wind too much due
E. Fewer on 26th, but an increase again on 27th. At Bell Rock,
however, one bird on 15th, and three on 19th only. Stragglers
only from the direct wave. We are more than ever convinced
of the influence of the wave from Heligoland <i>not</i> extending
much beyond Isle of May and Bell Rock. A new light will
soon be on the light vessel of the Carr Rock, off the East Neuk
of Fife; and we are in hopes that a good observer will be
stationed there, who has had personal experience and knowledge
of birds before. On 13th March only one record at
Bell Rock; on 11th only two at XXVII. and one at Pentland
Skerries.</p>

<p>In April "Crested Larks" are entered, and a previous entry
of the same is given on March 11th, both from XXVII. (Isle of
May. [We would like to have examined these, and added the
<i>real</i> Crested Lark to the Isle of May Museum.] Not many
records in April.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;A few flying round the light on 24th August
at N. Unst. Desultory movements at N. Unst in September.</p>

<p>In October about the 15th, 16th, 18th, an appearance of a
"rush," or an actual "rush" on 18th at VIII. (N. Ronaldshay),
and on 14th at XXVII. (Isle of May). At former 40 struck.
E.S.E. wind. At latter "large numbers," with a S.W. gale,
sleet. These no doubt are blown <i>off the land</i>. Latest date 18th.
But reports in newspapers of immense gatherings of Larks near
Dundee, St Andrews, and Midlothian and elsewhere, in January
and again in March, being only, no doubt, local congregations
caused by frost and snow in Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sturnin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;All returns for spring light. Earliest, February
9th at XXVII., and 11th at XIV. From 16th to 20th
light returns, flock on 18th. By the 11th March breeding birds
had arrived and taken up their haunts on XXVII., and about
the same time an odd bird or two were seen resting on rocks of
XXVI. (Bell Rock). Wind light westerly. As no records
occur at Bell Rock at any other time in spring this year, even
these odd birds occurring just at the time of arrivals elsewhere
are significant perhaps of the general movement, these birds no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">- 28 -</span>
doubt having overshot the land. Odd records in April at Fidra;
a pair breeding there in May.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Earliest movement noticed at XXVII. "Large
flocks of young birds, strangers." No records anywhere in
September. In October movements noted at IV, (N. Unst)
between 11th and 25th. On 11th flocks flying east, with light
S.E. wind and haze. Only one record at XXVI. (Bell Rock) on
8th October. Rush decided at XXVII. on 17th, with strong E.,
rain and haze; two killed. Small movements at IV, VII, (Sumburgh
Head), and XXVII. in November, and a few up to end
of January 1886.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corvid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Earliest spring record of Rooks at XIV. (Pentland
Skerries). Strong N.W. wind on 28th February. Rooks are
recorded from the following stations:&mdash;VIII. (N. Ronaldshay),
XIV, XXVII. (Isle of May); but all returns are very light
indeed. In the first week in March a slight rush apparent at
Sumburgh Head of Black and Hooded Crows&mdash;on 1st 50, on 6th
18, light N. to N.E.; and a few almost every day at XXVII. at
same time. Records of Carrion and Hooded Crows are from
VII. (Sumburgh Head), VIII., XIV., and XXVII. Earliest 1st
March; latest 29th April. From three or four to eight or ten
daily; long straggling migration.</p>

<p><i>Jackdaws</i> at XIV. on 25th, and 26th two, light W.N.W,, clear;
and at same place seven on 8th June and one on 13th, no doubt
visitors from either the Caithness coast or from Orkney.</p>

<p><i>Autumn.</i>&mdash;Similar movements of <i>Black Crows</i> at IV, on 30th
July, and at XIV. on 20th, 26th, two or three each time, Carrion
Crows and Hooded Crows reported in autumn from IV., VIII.,
XIV., XXVII., XXVIII. B. (Fidra) in a pretty continuous and
steady, though never heavy, stream, massing largest at IV. and
at XIV., two, three, four, to once twelve (on 11th September at
IV.) being the daily number observed. Dating from 1st record,
26th July, at XIV., to latest record, January 26th, 1886, one
bird at XXVII., with easterly and northerly gale. <i>Rooks</i>&mdash;Infinitesimal
movement; only two records, one in June and
one in December, both at IV. <i>Ravens</i>&mdash;Small number. Two
at IV. on 22d August, eight at IV. on 5th September, strong E.,
haze, feeding on rock; and two on 20th October at same place.
Four <i>Jackdaws</i> stopped a few days at N. Ronaldshay from the
6th November.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">- 29 -</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cypselid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At N. (Auskerry) flocks of Swifts seen on 1st
May, with the note "rarely seen till the middle of June, wind
N. and N.E., showers." Again seen at XXVII. on June 5th and
17th. We ourselves witnessed a party of Swifts migrating
close along the cliff-edge of Holborn Head, on the N. coast of
Caithness&mdash;"seven seen flying E., swiftly careering above the
cliff-edge of Holborn, and crossing in a direct line the Bay of
Thurso" (extract from Journal, 28th June 1885). We witnessed
also eight evidently still bent on migration, "flying in a
bee-line down Strathspey, high in air, at 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, near Black
Boats station. Clouds, heavy rains, showers, and N.W. wind"
(<i>loc. cit.</i>, May 16th, 1885). There is undoubtedly a great highway
of migration up and down the valley of the Spey, We
have abundant evidence of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Autumn.</span>&mdash;One record at IV. Two seen on 11th September,
light S., clear.</p>

<p><a id="Wryneck"></a><span class="smcap">Jyngin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Mr Agnew very ably describes the Wryneck as
follows, and it was afterwards identified and added to collection,
and the tail, which had been shot away, was recovered afterwards
by chance by Mr Wm. Evans, and restored to the specimen. Mr
Agnew writes, and we give it as showing how accurately to
describe a bird for purposes of identification:</p>

<p>"One bird, total stranger; very like a Partridge in markings;
size of a Lark; 4 toes on feet, 2 before and 2 behind; fore toes
largest; one of the hind toes not so large as the other; bill
about the size of a Pipit's; tongue protruding more than an inch,
thickly covered with fine hairs; &frac14;-inch of the tip horn, sharp as
a needle. Don't know what it is unless Ant-eater. Very sorry
tail shot away. Sent to Small for the Collection."&mdash;J. Agnew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuculid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;April 26th, an early date of arrival, flew low
from Dirleton woods towards XXVIII. B. (Fidra); light S.
breeze. In May, on 10th, at Cromarty, fresh N.E., showers; on
16th at XXVII., fresh W.N.W.; and on 28th at same station,
moderate S.W., clear. No autumn records.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strigid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;No spring returns. <i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Short-Eared
Owls recorded from XXVII. (Isle of May), one of 9th October, 6
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, N.W.; one 14th, N.E. gale; and one <i>shot</i> on 31st. The only
other record is at IX. (Start Point), when "an Owl made its
first appearance on the 6th November."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Falconid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Hawks, Sparrow Hawks, large Hawks, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">- 30 -</span>
Kestrel bulk pretty regularly, mostly, however, single birds at
XIV. and XXVII. in spring. Many daily records no doubt
refer to the same bird seen over and over again, especially when
such relate to Sparrow Hawks and Kestrels. Such visits are no
doubt only of local origin. "Large Hawks" at XXVII. are not
Peregrine Falcons, as such are well known to Mr Agnew, but
probably Buzzards or Harriers. One shot on 11th April unfortunately
fell into the sea and was not recovered. A "Dark-Brown
Hawk" also noted on 11th March at Isle of May.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;In August many local visits paid to flights of
small birds at most insular stations sending returns, especially
at IV., X., XIV., and XXVII. Falcons, Hawks, "large and
small," few in September, none in October recorded, and a few in
November. In former years three Eagles used to be seen
regularly; are now believed to have been killed out at IV.,
and we know that orders and rewards have been given to
the gamekeeper there for their destruction, as well as all
"vermin."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelecanid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Solan Geese.&mdash;Commencing in spring on 26th
March, three seen flying east at XIV, strong N. wind. We
may state here that winds seem to affect their passage very
little at all times. Began to appear flying N. past VIII. (N.
Ronaldshay) on April 18th, and flying east past XIV, 14th,
15th, and 20th&mdash;winds S.W. to S.S.E., and back to S.W., on the
three dates respectively. An April "flock," and "flocks all
day," by the 26th. Before that, usually in afternoons, and not
in forenoons. In June "the number of Gannets flying, usually
N. past VIII., increasing;" 10th, 19th, 20th, 25th, "flock,"
"flocks," "several flocks," "three." July to September, constant
in "flights" of two to twelve. On September 4th, in
haze and fog, flying N. past XIV., and always N. past VIII.
Going E. still in October, few in November, and two records in
December "seen fishing."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At XIX. (Cromarty) seen on shore, 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, calm, haze.
Two records in April at Cromarty and Fidra (XXVIII. B.); one
in May at XXVII. (Isle of May); two in July&mdash;12th and 22d&mdash;flying
N.E. at XIV.; three to six records in September at XIX.
(Cromarty) and XIV.; one in October at XXVII.; and two
records at XIV. and XXVII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anatid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>In Spring.</i>&mdash;Between 2d and 19th February, a flock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">- 31 -</span>
of "Barnacle Geese" seen almost daily flying E. at different
hours of forenoon and afternoon; and on 6th and 25th two
flocks. Wind usually N. and E., except on 8th, 9th, and 10th,
when it was westerly. The above at XIX. (Cromarty). I
heard from other sources of the unusual quantities of Brent
Geese in the Cromarty Firth and elsewhere on the East Coast
this season&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, 1884-85&mdash;and also in 1885-86. The Geese at
XIX. continued to be observed on April 10th and 14th, 1885,
but not later.</p>

<p>Of <i>Swans</i>, only one record at VIII. (N. Ronaldshay), when
six seen.</p>

<p>Of <i>Eider Ducks</i>, two flocks at XXVII.&mdash;light S.E., clear&mdash;on
2d March; and by 16th April most of the Eiders left. On 4th
April flock of fifty males and females, about equal in number,
at XXVII. This lot left on 6th; numerous again on 20th; but
breeding birds and a few about XXVIII. B. (Fidra) on 26th
April. In May, on 7th, 10th, and 16th, three males and three
females all day about island, and continued till 21st&mdash;breeding,
no doubt. Long-Tailed Duck, 3, 2 [male] and 1 [female], at XXVII.
on 26th February 1885 (only record). A few Wild Ducks at
XXVIII. B. on 28th April. "Stock Ducks."&mdash;Two at XIV. on
2d May, where they breed. Three "King Ducks" are noted
at Isle of May, and the note "different from Eider" added
on 31st May 1885, and "had a white spot on the black
wings." (?)</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;We have records of Swans, Teal Duck, Stock
Ducks, Ducks, Eider Ducks (or Dunters), Wild-drake, Barnacle
Geese, and Widgeon. Stations returning are&mdash;VIII. (North
Ronaldshay), returning "number of Ducks of different kinds, as
Widgeons, Teal," and Eider Ducks "made appearance in great
numbers" on 10th and 15th September respectively. At
XIV., by far the largest returns of Ducks of sorts greatest in
September. XIX.&mdash;"Barnacle" (?) Geese on 18th October.</p>

<p>At XXVII., record of Eiders, "all young birds except one old
male," on 2d December; and latest record at XIV. of a flock
near the rocks on 27th.</p>

last year's migration, and can hardly be admitted as spring
movement at XIV. Oyster-Catcher&mdash;two entries in March and
April; the former at XIV., where two arrived; and the latter
at XXVII., where three were seen on the 13th April.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Golden Plover arrived 5th August, and usually
remain all winter. Odd birds at XIV., also in August.
On 6th September, single record of a Golden Plover; single
ditto in October at XIV. Straggling records of little real use
in tracing facts in November, when, however, they do <i>bulk</i>
largest. Odd notices in December and January 1886.</p>

<p>Other species noted are Green Plover (very few records),
Ring Plover (November, only one entry), Oyster-Catchers (only
taken notice of at XIV.&mdash;a flock in September), and "a number
all day" at 28th November at XIV.</p>

<p><i>Added to the List of Isle of May.</i>&mdash;<i>A Ruff</i> (<i>Machetes pugnax</i>)
sent for identification and for the collection, 5th May; light
N.E. wind, clear. Most of this huge migratory flight of all sorts
left by the afternoon of the 5th.</p>

<p>Sandpipers, Redshanks.&mdash;<i>Spring</i>, only two records of "Sandpipers,"
six on 7th Feb. 1885, at XXVII.; light S.W., clear;
and one "Yellow Shanked Sandpiper" <i>found dead</i> on 1st May
at XXVII. [We would be glad of wings and feet, or skin, of
as many different Sandpipers as Mr Agnew can send us.
Parcels once a month, or with each schedule. The true
"Yellow Shanked Sandpiper" is a N. American species, but
numbers of other <i>species</i> have yellow feet or legs.]</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;All records are crowded into September and
November. Species are Redshanks, "Grey Sandpiper," Common
Sandpiper, Purple Sandpiper. The "Common Sandpiper" is
recorded from N. Unst, but the species is uncertain. [Please
send wings or skin.]</p>

<p><i>Turnstones</i> are recorded, 18th Sept., at XXVII.; W.S.W.,
light, clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Larid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Every month in the year contains returns. Species
noted are Herring Gulls, "Dirty Allens" (or Skuas), "Gulls,"
"Black-Backed Gulls," "Kittiwakes," "Grey Megs" (or Common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">- 35 -</span>
Gull), Black-Headed Gulls, "Skua Gulls," Richardson's
Skuas.</p>

<p><i>Spring and Autumn.</i>&mdash;Every day plentiful in February, at
XXVII. and XXVIII. B. Gulls arrived at XV. (Dunnet Head)&mdash;and
left in August last&mdash;on 13th March 1885. Kittiwakes
appeared first on 12th March, at XXVII., "earlier than usual,"
and very numerous by 13th; "came from S.;" N.W., light, clear.
At XIV. seen all day flying around on 11th April; E.N.E., haze';
two Black B. Gulls sitting on rocks on 30th; S.S.E., haze. By
April 20th, Kittiwakes had settled down in summer quarters
on XXVII., and were in "multitudes" by 27th May. At XIV.
a pair of Herring Gulls bred in 1884, and again in the present
year, on same place; not before. In May, hundreds Black H.
Gulls on the lochs near VIII. to breed.</p>

<p>Records unimportant in June and July, except that "Dirty
Allens" are recorded at IV. on 2d July, and "Skua Gulls" at
XIV. on 7th. In August, movement of Kittiwakes and other
Gulls, and records continue numerously through the remaining
months.</p>

<p>G. Terns,&mdash;a number arrived to hatch, "as usual," at VIII. on
14th May, and Lesser Terns at XIX. on 24th May. The latter
disappeared again on 26th Aug.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Procellariid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>Autumn</i>, July 3d, flying about the rocks
at X. (Auskerry). In August, occasionally striking lantern at
IV., VII., IX. (Start Point), and XV. (Dunnet Head). They
breed at IX. among ruins of house, and under stones on shore.</p>

<p>September,&mdash;odd birds striking at IV. and at XIV. on five
dates; three on 2d Sept, at IV., and two at same place on 6th.
One record at IV. in October, and one at same place in November,
usually in foggy or rainy weather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;More or less records every month. Arrivals.
First spring visit of Guillemots and Razorbills at XXVII. on
8th March; remained in thousands to 15th; fewer up to 24th;
disappeared and returned in multitudes to breed by 13th April;
Puffins, Razorbills, and Guillemots. Also at VIII. "Rock Birds
seen flying N. daily till 8th May." <i>N.B.</i>&mdash;<i>Black Guillemots</i>
recorded at XXVII. on 5th May.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Puffins last seen at XIV. on 7th Aug., and all
other Rock Birds left except Kittiwakes, on the same day at
XXVII.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">- 36 -</span></p>

<p>Flock of Guillemots hung about XIV. for a time, and a few
more seen on 24th. Large numbers of Guillemots and Razorbills,
from 16th to 18th, at XXVII., when all left, and after a
W. gale large numbers on 2d Dec. and again on 31st Dec.
and seen occasionally till end of January. <i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Black Guillemots,
one seen at XXVII. on 27th Jan. 1886. We think it
quite possible <i>Black Guillemots</i> still breed on Isle of May,
perhaps one pair.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Bramblings are reported as having been more plentiful in Lincolnshire and
Norfolk than has been the case for very many years. In the Migration Report
for 1883, the Hawfinch is recorded at the Inner Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> on November 2d,
and at the same station in the previous year on October 20th. I have recently
ascertained from Mr William King that he was mistaken in his identification,
and that the birds were Bramblings.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> Mr J. H. Gurney, Sen., writes:&mdash;"Lord Lilford sends me word that on 20th
of March 1886, Mr G. Hunt saw an extraordinary flight of Rooks at Somerton,
which he observed from 10.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> till 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, when he left, but the flight was
still going on. He wrote to Lord Lilford:&mdash;'I observed them flying just above
the sandhills, going due south, and as far as the eye could see both before and
behind there was nothing but Rooks. There would never for one moment of the
day be less than a thousand in sight at one time; they kept in a thin wavering
line. The coast line here runs due north and south.'" Mr J. H. Gurney,
Jun., writes:&mdash;"I saw the same Rooks and Grey Crows on the same day in much
smaller numbers as were seen at Somerton (Norfolk coast), which is fifteen miles
further south. I again saw them on the 21st, 22d, 25th, 26th, 29th, but none
after that date. Mr Hunt says they were all Rooks, but with me Grey Crows
preponderated; direction to S.E." In connection with this read Mr G&auml;tke's
notes of migration as observed at Heligoland and Hanover between March 19th
and 25th, 1886, on the last page of his journal.</p>

<h3 id="General_Notes"><span class="smcap">General Notes.</span></h3>

<p>With reference to the rush of birds on October 16th and 17th,
Mr Thomas O. Hall of the <span class="smcap">Longstone L.H.</span> writes:&mdash;"October
16th. Starlings and Redwings commenced to come at 1.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>,
and continued to daylight; after that they continued to come
all day, but not in large numbers. One Tree Sparrow. Wind
easterly. October 17th. An enormous rush of Redwing and
Starling; not many of the other kinds, only a few Blackbirds
and Larks. One Woodcock was injured against the lantern,
one Jacksnipe killed, also one Brambling. One female Redstart
seen. Several Woodcock were shot on the adjacent islands
by a boat from shore, so that there was a large flight. The
rush of birds was continuous from 1.45 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to 5.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> The
greater part of the Starlings caught were young birds. There
were also some Knot flying round the lantern, but none struck.
The wind was east, with drizzling rain." Again, with regard to
the November rush which was continuous on the 10th and
11th:&mdash;"November 8th. A few Redwings and Larks heard
after dark, and one Fieldfare on the gallery at midnight. Wind
S. to S.W., moderate. 9th. A few Fieldfare heard through the
morning, and two Skylarks seen at 10.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Several Fieldfare
and Knot flying round from 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> till midnight; one Skylark
and one Fieldfare caught. Wind from S.W. to S.S.E., and
at midnight S.S.E. 10th. Fieldfares flying more plentifully
than in fore part of the night, but not striking. No other birds
seen. The flight of Fieldfares continued all day, one flock of
fifty and another of two hundred passed in afternoon, also five
Blackbirds and one Corby Crow in the afternoon. The Fieldfare
continued up to 10.38 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, when the weather became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">- 54 -</span>
clearer. One of the large Snipe struck S.E. side of lantern at
9.45 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and was almost smashed to pieces; one Dunlin also
killed; wind S. by E. to S.E. by S. 11th. Fieldfares, Redwings,
and Blackbirds coming all day and all through the night,
also Skylarks. One Jacksnipe killed. Wind from S. round by
E. to N.E., light, with passing showers of drizzle. 12th. The
same birds as yesterday still coming all day, and continuing up
to 11 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>; wind from S.W. to W. by N., moderate. At 1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Malmo</span>, Sweden.&mdash;Mr Frank E. Newton sends a cutting
from a Gotland newspaper, of which the following is a translation:&mdash;"A
curious circumstance happened at the F[)a]r&ouml; Lighthouse
on the 20th October. About 8.30 in the evening a sharp
report was heard by the man on watch. He immediately went
up to the lantern to ascertain the cause, when he found two of
the panes of glass broken into small pieces, as well as three
"Alfoglar" (Long-Tailed Ducks, <i>Harelda glacialis</i>) lying dead
inside. There were also three lamp glasses broken, and a third
pane of glass cracked in many places. On the ground below
lay nine more birds of the same sort. The Ducks had come
from a northerly direction. The flight must have been at a
remarkable speed, as the quarter-inch thick glass was smashed
into many small pieces."</p>

<p>Schedules have been sent in since the writing of the report
from <span class="smcap">Inner Farn L.H.</span>&mdash;Mr Thomas H. Cutting&mdash;ranging from
February 11th to March 30th, 1886, and recording a large
migration of Skylarks during the forenoon on February 19th to
the W.; also the movements of Blackbirds, Thrushes, Common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">- 56 -</span>
Wrens, Lapwing, Snipe, Starlings, Golden Plover, Daws, and
"Black Crows." A pair of Wheatears on February 22d, at 5
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and again a pair on March 25th. A small flock of Snow-Bunting
on March 13th, and three Fieldfare on the .30th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Galloper L.V.</span>&mdash;Mr P. Frost:&mdash;From January 21st to April
12th, 1886, is specially interesting as recording the enormous
migration of Larks and Starlings, and in less numbers of Chaffinches,
Sparrows, Linnets, and Plover. On the nights of January
21st to 23d, two hundred and twenty-six were killed. Unfortunately
Mr Frost fails to state the directions of flights, but, judging
from the entries in the schedules sent in by other light-vessels
on the south-east coast, they refer to birds on passage
both to the Continent and our own shores.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newarp L.V.</span>&mdash;Messrs C. Campbell and W. Rees:&mdash;From
October 21st to March 21st, 1886, up to February 14th. Crows,
Starlings, Larks, Chaffinches, Blackbirds, Thrushes, Fieldfares,
Bramblings, and Linnets in greater or less numbers to the W.,
ceasing on December 11th, and again recommencing on January
23d to February 14th, and then from March 5th to 21st, Starlings,
Larks, and Crows passing to the E.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swin Middle L.V.</span>&mdash;Messrs Pender and J. Barrett:&mdash;From
January 21st to April 3d, 1886; between January 21st to
February 15th. Immense flights of Larks, generally during the
night, and large numbers killed; also Starlings, Sparrows, and
some Chaffinches. On January 24th, five flocks of small birds
travelling from N.W. to S.E. On the night of February 14th to
15th, Larks still in great numbers, ninety on deck, and a great
many falling into the water, "for two hours the Larks were like
a shower of snow." March 28th and 29th, and April 1st, 2d,
3d, Chaffinches at intervals during the morning three or four
together, all were male birds, only one female seen. "Ducks"
(probably Scoters) "can be seen from this vessel eight or nine
months in the year, but on February 10th, 11th, 12th, we had
calms and fogs, and the Ducks sat on the water, covering about
a mile, the water being black with them."</p>

<p>Lord Clifton writes:&mdash;"About twenty Swallows were picked
up dead after the northerly gales and rain of October 13th and
14th. Seven were found huddled together alive in a duck's
nesting-box in a stable, and one was found dead in a slipper in a
bedroom, so desperate were the efforts of the poor birds to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">- 57 -</span>
warmth and shelter. House Martins were similarly overtaken."
"Golden Oriole."&mdash;"On June 9th a bricklayer thought he saw
one, and on the 23d a woodcutter said he both saw one and
heard it whistle; our people about here are familiar with the
general appearance of the bird from its having bred in this park
in 1874 and 1875."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span></h3>

<p>A special point of interest in the report for the East Coast of
England was the large arrival of Pied Flycatchers at Spurn and
Flamborough in the first week in May 1885, with a north-east
wind. This immigration extended northward as far as the
Pentland Skerries (see Report from the <a href="#EAST_COAST_OF_SCOTLAND">East Coast of Scotland</a>).
At Flamborough the Flycatchers were accompanied by male
Redstarts.</p>

<p>There was an enormous arrival of Redwings, commencing at
the Farn Islands on September 15th, and continued throughout
October and November to the first week in December, and
covering the whole east coast of England. There was also an
immense immigration of Fieldfares, which was specially observed
at the Longstone <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> from November 8th to 11 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on
the 12th.</p>

<p>Scarcely second to these in importance was the immense
flight of Bramblings, the bulk of which arrived in two great
rushes between October 14th and 17th and on November 11th
and 12th; this species being reported as more plentiful in the
eastern counties than ever previously recorded.</p>

<p>The main body of Woodcocks arrived in two great rushes,
the "first flight" on the night of October 16th to 17th, covering
the east coast from the Farn Islands to Thanet, and the "great
flight" on October 22d to 23d and 23d to 24th between the same
islands and Yarmouth. After this. Woodcocks kept dropping
in at intervals up to the end of January 1886.</p>

<p>It has been remarked in previous reports that the migration
of a species extends over many weeks, and in some cases is extended
for months. Yet it is observable that, at least on the
east coast of England, year by year, the bulk or main body of
the birds which strike the coast come in two enormous and
almost continuous rushes during the second and third weeks in
October and the corresponding weeks in November. Continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">- 58 -</span>
observation also proves that the earlier arrivals, as a rule, refer
to the young of the year, and the later to old birds, but with
many exceptions.</p>

<p>Birds also continue persistently, year by year, to follow the
same lines of flight both in the spring and autumn, and at least
nine-tenths of the arrivals at the latter season come directly
from the east or from points south of east, moving to the west
and north-west. In the spring, when leaving the east coast,
they travel in the reverse direction, but still following the old
lines. The occurrences of migrants coming from points north
of east is quite exceptional.</p>

<p>The fact of a double migration or passage of birds of the same
species across the North Sea in the spring and autumn, both to
the E. and S.E. and W. and N.W., is very clearly established
(see General Remarks, 1884 Report, East Coast of England, pp.
69 and 70). This phenomenon is regularly recorded on the
whole of the east coast, but specially observable at those light-vessels
which are stationed in the south-east district included in
this report; at the same time, it is invariably persistent and
regular year by year.</p>

<p>An examination of the reports, seven in number, already
issued by the Committee, will show the extreme regularity and
precision in time during which the migration of each species is
carried on. This applies both to the vernal and autumnal
passage; in the vast majority of cases the commencement of
the migration occurring on the same day, or within a few days,
of a fixed period, so that it would not be difficult to tabulate in
advance with almost certainty the normal movement or migration
of each species.</p>

<p>The arrivals of rare and occasional visitants have been unusually
few; perhaps those of chief interest are the occurrences of
the Arctic Bluethroat and Desert Chat at Spurn, the Black-Bellied
Dipper in Lincolnshire, the Woodchat Shrike, Serin
Finch, and Spoonbill in Norfolk, and the Spotted Eagle in
Northumberland.</p>

<p>In the spring the earliest occurrence of our summer visitants
is as frequently recorded at the northern as at the southern
stations; instance the arrival in 1885 of the Swallow at Spurn
on April 8th; the Swift, several, on April 20th; and the
Cuckoo at Whitby on April 8th; and in 1886 the arrival of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">- 59 -</span>
Wheatears at the Farn Islands on February 2 2d. The line of
migration of the latter, as yearly observed at the Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, is
from S.E. to N.W.</p>

<h4><i>Addenda to "General Notes," East Coast of England.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Leman and Ower L.V.</span>&mdash;Mr T. Artis:&mdash;March 19th to 28th,
1886. On March 19th and 25th "Black Crows" N.W. to S.E.;
and between March 19th to 28th, Skylarks, Starlings, Chaffinches,
and others to W. March 28th, at 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, S.S.E., fog.
One Fieldfare, three Starlings, three Chaffinches, one Woodcock,
and three Bramblings killed. Mr Artis also remarks, under date
of April 13th, 1886, 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and 7 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>:&mdash;"I have to inform you
that this afternoon, being a calm at the time, I saw close to my
vessel, about three ship's length off, a very large creature which
I believe was some sort of a whale. I never saw such a fish
near the Leman and Ower banks (18 fathoms) before. It appeared
to be larger than the ship, and came from the N.W.,
going S.E., and at 7 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> he was surrounded by spring
herrings&mdash;some thousands&mdash;leaping out of the water from three to four
feet. It was a beautiful sight."</p>

<p>There is a very interesting schedule, which is carried forward
to the next report (1886), from the Longstone <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Mr
Thomas O. Hall. A Woodcock was flushed on the 3d of April
on the rock, which flew E. On April 7th, at 9.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, two
flocks of Hooded Crows passed to mainland, wind W., strong;
and on the 13th a small flock of Books passed to mainland at
7.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, wind S.E. and E. There was a great flight of Fieldfares,
Redstarts, and Wheatears, and other kinds, round the
lantern between 12 and 1 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the 28th April. As soon
as the wind shifted to the N.E. all the birds left.</p>

<p><i>T. viscivorus</i>, daily a few; never coming numerous. <i>Char.
auratus</i> and <i>vanellus</i>, as <i>Tot. calidris</i> only singly. Ought to
have been <i>merula</i> and <i>scolopax</i>, but if hoar-frost turns up early,
there is never much visible migration.</p>

<p>31st, S.E., quite light, clear, strong hoar-frost, during daytime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">- 64 -</span>
warm.&mdash;Early, nothing, and during daytime almost nothing, in
spite of fine weather. <i>C. cornix</i> and <i>monedula</i>, very single small

one. <i>F. c&#339;lebs</i>, <i>cannabina</i>, <i>chloris</i>, as <i>Anthus</i> all very single.</p>

<p>Strange, that in forenoon, after all hoar-frost had disappeared,
and it became quite warm and sunny, not a <i>merula</i> or <i>scolopax</i>
arrived, and no Crows passed, the few flights of the latter passing
surprisingly high, certainly several thousand feet, which is
very uncommon, as the usual normal boundary is 500 to
600 feet. Can this give rise to the conclusion that other species
whose normal route of migration lays always very high, should
under the influence of hoar-frost migrate so high that they can
neither be seen nor heard, which would be in the case of Crows
about 10,000 feet?</p>

<p>In rare cases I have seen Rooks and Daws pass so high, that
my attention being roused by their call, they were only visible
in the shape of very fine dust.</p>

<p>The same also happens that under favourable atmospheric
circumstances, the calls sound down clear from a height to
which the sense of sight is unable to penetrate.</p>

<p>In previous years the Heligoland notes have been incorporated
with the returns from the East Coast of England, and
they are now printed separately for the first time. The special
thanks of the Committee are due to Mr G&auml;tke for his interesting
and valuable contributions to their report.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="WEST_COAST_OF_SCOTLAND">WEST COAST OF SCOTLAND.</h2>
</div>


<p>Schedules, etc., were sent to thirty-four stations, not including
the Isle of Man (five more), the schedules of which are
passed on to Mr Eagle Clarke for incorporation with the West
Coast of England. Of the thirty-four we have received returns
from seventeen.</p>

<p>Additional interest and more painstaking schedule-work is
evident at the more productive stations. From Monach Islands
three schedules have been sent, but they are written straight
across the columns, making it extremely difficult for the committee
to tabulate the contents. As far as possible, the columns
should be used for the purposes given in the headings, as otherwise
the labours of members of committee is very largely increased.
All the scheduled items must be passed first into a
ledger for the purpose, under species in each month, in the season,
and then only can the report be written out. We give prominence
to this explanation, as we are very desirous that our
reporters adhere to the columnar arrangement.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Diary from the Stations.</span></h3>

<p><i>Butt of Lewis.</i>&mdash;Alexander Thompson and Gilbert Mackinnon,
one schedule from March 24th to November 17th, carefully
filled. On the 15th and 16th, large whales seen close to lighthouse,
going S.E. on the flood tide. Starlings, Rock Doves,
remain all the year round, and "Sandlarks" arrive in May, and
stay till end of August. During July, "great flocks of Gannets
continually going to and fro in search of fish." An amusing incident
was witnessed by Mr Mackinnon. On the evening of the
10th August, a Gull got hold of a large "saith" fish<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>; was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">- 94 -</span>
unable to rise with it, so it towed it to the rocks, and allowed
the sea to wash it up on the rocks. Some boys went after it,
when it took to the water again, and pulled the fish to another
rock, and again allowed the sea to wash it up, where it eat its
supper in peace.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> <i>Gadus virens</i>, Lin.</p>

</div>

<p><a id="Monach_Isles"></a><i>Monach Isles.</i>&mdash;Donald Georgeson&mdash;Three quarterly schedules.
Mr Georgeson's schedules are able and masterly; and if we could
have <i>all</i> our schedules returned in a similar epitomised condition,
no doubt much time might be saved; <i>but</i> in the meantime,
schedules coming from a . few stations out of so many
stations, so epitomised, whilst the rest adhere rigidly to the
columnar arrangement, makes it more troublesome to arrange
details. Uniform attention to the columnar arrangement is
simplest for the ledger work.</p>

<p>The following is an abstract of Mr Georgeson's three quarterly
schedules, and may be referred to under <i>species</i> in the next
portion of the report:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr Georgeson writes&mdash;"This is an island little frequented by
either land or sea birds. The only birds that struck the lantern
were a few Snow Buntings and the Common Tern [Arctic Tern
<i>vera</i>?.&mdash;J. A. H. B.] Towards the end of January we had a
severe gale from the S.W." Mr G. found several Terns and
Snow Buntings "dead from exposure." "<i>The S.W. is the prevailing
wind here.</i>" (Explaining, perhaps, the above stated scarcity
of birds, as pressing them more easterly on their S.E. course
after doubling Butt of Lewis.&mdash;J. A. H. B.) A single Snipe
appeared among the "marshy pools" of the islands. "In
January and February I observed a large flock of Wild Geese,
coming from the U.E., and after resting on the outlying rocks
here, they rose and flew west in the direction of St Kilda."
Shieldrakes&mdash;Two males and one female, in February, seen feeding
on the island, and three Common Gulls and two Black-Backed
Gulls. 1st March. Fifty Linnets (Twites?) paid a visit,&mdash;wind
south&mdash;stayed only a short time. A few Sandpipers
remained a week, but departed when the weather broke. Rock
Doves visited the island, but soon left. Sea birds observed from
January 1st to March 31st are&mdash;Common Duck, Eider Duck,
Northern Diver, and a few Scarts, but these also disappeared
with a gale on the 20th March from quarters between S. and N.W.</p>

<p>In Mr Georgeson's next six months' bulletin, he reports:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">- 95 -</span></p>

<p>April 3d, wind S.W. Three Ravens and two Hooded Crows, and
one <i>Golden Plover</i>&mdash;local migration. He also mentions Sand
Larks arriving to breed about the 5th April. "The only land
birds that remained the winter are a few Rock and Meadow
Pipits, which breed here in large numbers; also about a dozen
pairs of Wheatears and a few "Linnets" (<i>i.e.</i>, Twites.&mdash;J. A. H. B.)
Two nests of the Eider Duck on the island in May. Early in
May the wind was light and variable. The only birds I saw
were three Black-Backed Gulls and five Herring Gulls, and a few
Eider Ducks, but as the breeding season advanced they left the
island. Two pairs of Shielducks came to the island <i>from the
direction of St Kilda</i>&mdash;wind light, N.E.&mdash;and were seen flying
away in spring with their young in a N.E. direction. There are
no Scarts here in the breeding season. They and other rock
birds leave for more suitable rocks as the season advances.
Large flocks of Pictarnies arrive here in June, and breed in great
numbers, the island being covered with their nests.</p>

<p>In the last quarterly schedule Mr Georgeson tells us ;&mdash;By
the 24th August the land birds had all left, except a few "Linnets"
(<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Twites</i>&mdash;J. A. H. B.), a few Rock and Marsh (<i>i.e.</i>,
"<i>Meadow</i>") Pipits. A <i>Corncrake</i>, a very unusual bird here,
came to our garden on 11th August, but left on the corn being
cut. September 7th, a few <i>Scarts</i> returned, and fifty to sixty
Kittiwakes. Many <i>Solan Geese</i>. Two Herons seen feeding on
rocks on September 8th flew off on the 10th seaward. October
5th, large flock of Snow Buntings part of the day, and then
flew off in a N.E. direction. On the 20th October a large flock
of Wild Geese came from N.E. with a N.E. wind, lighted to
rest, and then flew off <i>west</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, out to sea). Snipe usually remain
over the winter at Monach, but leave in the breeding-season.
On night of November 10th to 11th a Woodcock&mdash;a
rare bird here&mdash;struck, along with Terns, Mavis, and Blackbirds.
Another rare bird was found dead same morning, the name of
which I do not know. "Exact colour of a Kittiwake, the size
of a Stormy Petrel. (No doubt the Grey Phalarope, young
bird of the year.&mdash;J. A. H. B.) A large flock of "Pictarnies"
(<i>i.e.</i>, Terns) came from E., rested, and then flew away west,
wind N.E. at the time, on same day.</p>

<p><i>Barra Head Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;William Irvine. One short schedule
from February to June. Mr Irvine writes:&mdash;"Bernacle Geese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">- 96 -</span>
last seen on the 24th April on this island." There is some
little confusion about Bernacle and Brent Geese. Could Mr
Irvine send us a head of the so-called "Bernacle Geese?"&mdash;J. A. H. B.</p>

<p>Marten Swallows (<i>Hirundo urbica</i>) were seen on June 10th
hawking over the surface of the ground. Major H. W. Feilden
and Harvie-Brown visited Barra Head in 1871, and it is easily
understood why it should <i>not</i> be a favourable observatory of
land birds. (See "Barra Head and Its Bird Life," and previous
Reports.)</p>

<p><i>Rona</i>, Skye.&mdash;Messrs Dunnet and M'Gaw send a short
schedule&mdash;March 20th to November 17th. The contents appear
under Species. Northern Divers seem to be often seen about
this district of coast, and also at Kyleakin Ferry (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><i>Skerryvore.</i>&mdash;Mr Thomas Dawson sends three carefully-filled
schedules. Rush of Thrushes, &amp;c., on 12th March, continuing
on 15th to 16th. Several birds have been named from the
wings sent by Mr Dawson; and from description and drawing
the <i>Pomatorhine Skua must</i> have been observed on the 25th May.
Later Mr Dawson writes:&mdash;"Not one land bird seen here since
28th November till to-day." Date of last schedule, January
19th, 1886. Even the Eider Ducks have deserted us for months
past. Yesterday, continuous flocks of either Marrots or Razorbills
passing south. Fresh, variable.</p>

<p><i>Kyleakin.</i>&mdash;Messrs D. M'Culloch and John Clyne write, with
two well-filled schedules.</p>

<p>This is an exceptional year here. On the 16th November, at
2.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, with fresh (?) breeze and haze, two "Mavises" and
six Starlings struck&mdash;<i>the first birds known to strike the glass for
the last eight years</i>&mdash;and others seen in the rays of light. More
birds have been observed this season in a few minutes than have
been noticed for years. On the 27th November, wind S.W.,
fresh, gale with snow all night, and two hours after the gale
took off, great flocks of Starlings passed from 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> till dark,
only a few inches from the ground. These birds had either
been driven out of their course with the gale and snowstorm, or
had taken a new course of their own accord.</p>

<p><i>Dhuheartach</i>, S.W. of Iona.&mdash;Mr William Davidson sends two
schedules carefully filled under correct columns&mdash;a practice
which cannot be too highly commended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">- 97 -</span></p>

<p><i>Skervuile.</i>&mdash;Mr John Ewing also sends us four capital
schedules, strictly adhering to the columnar arrangement.</p>

<p><i>Rhinns of Islay.</i>&mdash;Messrs Peter Anderson and James Ducat
send eight excellent schedules, clearly proving, as has been done
before, the superiority of this observation station; and I think
in our first Report we give prominence to the situation as intercepting
the S.E. flow of returning migrants from the Outer
Hebrides.</p>

<p>Messrs Anderson and Ducat are much interested in the work,
and many birds have been sent us by them for identification.
They write:&mdash;"The last date on which we saw Solan Geese
last year was on the last day of November, and the first day
this year was on 29th February. Birds resident in the vicinity
are, amongst others, Starling, Curlew, Snipe, Jack Snipe (?),<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Twites or 'Rock Linnets,' Sparrows, and Larks. Later in summer
Gannets or Solan Geese are seen daily 'flying east and
west,' and 'circling about fishing, from an odd pair to 100 in
all weathers,' A vast congregation of Marrots and Puffins fishing
around the island on 19th August, and some hundreds of
Gannets, old and young, 'floating along with the tide, so full
they cannot rise.' All disappeared on 21st."</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;We would be obliged if Mr Anderson and Mr Ducat
would adhere to the columnar arrangement, and not write
across the red lines, or as little as they can help.</p>

<p>Hundreds of <span class="smcap">Moths</span> also are reported "of various sizes flying
about the lantern on 7th September." A great Skua?&mdash;("Dirty
Allan of the largest size")&mdash;seen on 7th September.
Also on the night of the 3d September Messrs A. and D.
write:&mdash;"We have had enormous numbers of what is locally
called 'Jenny Long-legs' about the station for the past three
or four weeks, and in the mornings there are great numbers of
their legs and wings lying on the pavement. This morning,
after putting out the light, I watched, when I saw about twenty
Mosscheepers (<i>i.e.</i>, Pipits) working hard to make their breakfast
off them. <i>I never before</i> saw so many Long-legs in the fall.
There is a usual <i>run in April!</i>"</p>

<p>From Mr Peter Anderson we have the following earnest appeal
to other stations:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;I beg to return you the concluding schedule for this year,
and most likely I have put a lot of remarks into it and previous ones
that are of little account, and some of the wings I sent to you were
most likely very common ones to you, although they were strange to
me, or I had some doubts about them; but as I have now got the
names of some of the odd ones in this locality, I will not likely
trouble you with so many again. If my suggestion of including
assistants as well as principals in filling up the schedules has been
of any advantage this year, I would further suggest for 1886 that
you should make a strong appeal to all stations to try for one year
to give you all the information (and especially those who have not as
yet sent in any or meagre returns) they can. First, what birds&mdash;or
as many as they can ascertain&mdash;breed in then' near locality. Second,
when do Stonechicks (which I believe are all over Scotland), Snow
Buntings, Robins, Wrens, and several other small birds arrive which
make their appearance only at certain seasons. In looking over the
Report for 1884, the point that annoyed me most was, that I could
not make out the names and terms of all the different species; but
at John o' Groat's School thirty-five years ago there was no word
of Latin. In '84's Report I expected to have seen better reports
from some stations that I know, such as North Unst, Start Point,
and Noss Head. At North Unst there are several migrants which
build on the rock, and I wondered to see no account of Mother
Carey's Chickens, as they breed on the rock, and at the end of
August they annoyed us a good deal by striking the lantern and
emitting an oily substance on the glass. At Start Point the Sheldrake
breeds, and I have seen the Stock Duck breed on it also; and
I was told there were thirteen species of Ducks frequented that
locality, and I have seen Teal and Widgeon there in hundreds.
Also at Noss Head there are various classes of birds which visit it
in the breeding season. I once knew of a Grebe got in a small pond
there. Trusting you won't feel annoyed at the above remarks, I am,
etc.,</p>

<p class="tdr">
<span class="smcap">Peter Anderson.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p><i>Lamlash.</i>&mdash;Messrs David Scott and Robert Brown send us one
schedule. The remark occurs that "the Thrush is becoming
very scarce here."</p>

<p><i>Turnberry.</i>&mdash;A carefully-filled schedule&mdash;dating March 11 to
November 10&mdash;sent by Messrs Andrew Nisbet (principal) and
Wm. Beggs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">- 99 -</span> (assistant). Species well distinguished.</p>

<p><i>Corsewall.</i>&mdash;A good schedule also from Mr Robert Laidlaw,
and all the species apparently well distinguished.</p>

<p><i>Portpatrick.</i>&mdash;Mr James Beggs sends a short but good schedule,
with the remark: "Migration of birds this season has been very
slight, and we think the cause is owing to so much prevailing
winds from the west occurring on this coast [<i>i.e.</i>, taking the
birds further west at further north points.&mdash;J. A. H. B.].
Flights of Black Crows [Rooks.&mdash;J. A. H. B.] come and go to
this vicinity all the winter through. [<i>Note.</i>&mdash;Ravens are known
to congregate on this coast at certain points.&mdash;J. A. H. B.]
Great flights of Gannets in July, August, and September, and
then cease till early spring. Fly both ways&mdash;north and south."</p>

<p>On November 10, <i>Red-legged Kaw</i> seen flying south at 3.40
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, close to lighthouse. (Is this still of the native breed, or a
migrant from further north?&mdash;J. A. H. B.)</p>

<p><i>Mull of Galloway.</i>&mdash;Two well-filled schedules from Messrs
Alex. Murray and John M'Quarrie. "A large Grey Owl. picked
up one of the small birds on the grating on the 17th October,
plucked it, and swallowed it whole. I tried to catch it, but it
flew off."</p>

<p><i>Little Ross.</i>&mdash;Mr James Ferrier I have to thank for two
excellently-prepared schedules; and we feel sure that this
station, though it may not yield large numerical returns, will
give returns of considerable interest, whether negative or
positive.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Separate Report under Genera and Species.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>In Spring</i>, a few odd birds&mdash;Blackbirds and
Thrushes&mdash;passed 93 (Skerryvore) and 114 (Little Ross). In
March, these increased in numbers at both these stations on 7th,
11th, 12th, and 15th, and odd birds were also noticed at 109
(Turnberry) on 11th and 13th. Apparently almost a rush
noticed at 93, with wind light N.W. on 12th, but S.W. and haze
on 15th. Fieldfares also noted at Little Ross on 24th, with
strong S.E.; one killed. On April 14th, a rush of Thrushes at
94 (Dhuheartach) all night, light variable wind and haze; also
Redwings and Blackbirds at Rhinns of Islay on 12th, and two
Ring Ouzels all night at Little Ross. Blackbirds seen flying
S.W. at 94, on 17th June, complete the spring records.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Scarcely any movement in September, but in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">- 100 -</span>
October, considerable numbers of <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>. Earliest record in
autumn, one Thrush on 1st September at 109, and one Ring
Ouzel on 15th at 102 (Rhinns of Islay); and latest record
November 16th [if we except two records on 22d and 23d
January 1886, which really belong either to local influence, or
is a beginning of the spring migration of 1886]. Thus the
migration of <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>, in 1885 is almost unique amongst our
records for the shortness, suddenness, and rapidity with which
it was accomplished, occupying limits strongly defined in time
by the above dates, <i>viz.</i>, in all&mdash;leaving out the two solitary
September records&mdash;only from 9th October to 16th November,
or 38 days. The stations participating in the rush are 93
(Skerryvore), 94 (Dhuheartach), 101 (Skervuile), 102 (Rhinns
of Islay), 108 (Lamlash), 109 (Turnberry), 113 (Mull of Galloway),
and 114 (Little Ross). More specialised rushes were:&mdash;On
17th, of <i>Thrushes</i> and <i>Missel Thrushes</i> at 94, and of <i>Redwings</i>
at Rhinns of Islay; on 10th and 11th November, of Missel
Thrushes and Fieldfares, with few Mavises, at 93, 94, and of the
same species in small numbers, with large numbers of Thrushes,
Blackbirds, and Redwings, on 9th, 10th, 11th, up to 16th, at all
stations. Most at 93 and 94, but movement extensive and general
at all, and suddenly over by the 16th, if we except one solitary
record of five Mavises on the 21st at (Kyleakin) 90, the only
record from that station of <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>. Prevailing wind strong
S.S.E. to S.E., and back to S., all these two months; sometimes
northerly in October, but never for long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxicolin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>In Spring</i>, an extensive migration of Wheatears
and (or) "Stonechats." [The name Stonechat is the one almost
universally used at 93, 94, 101, 102, and 113, but "Wheatear"&mdash;the
more correct name for the species intended&mdash;is used at
88 (Fladda) and 114 (Little Ross). The true Stonechat has a
black head, and is about the same size as a Whinchat, <i>i.e.</i>, much
smaller than the Wheatear. But the name "Stonechat" is of
almost universal use in Scotland for the Wheatear&mdash;indeed, a
generally accepted local name.] Earliest record in spring, April
4th, at 102 (Rhinns of Islay); latest, 2d June, at 93 (Skerryvore).
The general rush took place between the 11th and 20th,
and appears to have been unusually heavy, such terms being
used, at all stations, as "numbers all night," "fifty," "forty,"
"great numbers," "rush all night," "hundreds all night," etc.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">- 101 -</span>
Perhaps 12th and 13th had the greatest share, but it would be
difficult to say which station participated most largely. 109
(Turnberry), however, has only one record of odd birds on 14th
April. The May records are all at 93 and 94, and are all light.
There are also two records of Whinchats at 114, on 21st and
2 2d of April. The prevailing wind was easterly in April, and
oftener S. of E. than N. of E. In May the wind was westerly
at 93 and 94, and again S.E. at 93 on June 2d, the latest
record.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn</i>, a partial rush took place at 101 (Skervuile), where
"numbers at midnight" were seen on the 6th. Records come
from the following stations, principally 93 and 94, a few from
101 and 102. All records in September are from 93 and 94,
and all are very light indeed, except at 94 upon the 6th September,
when a rush of Stonechats, Wagtails, and Titlarks took
place, with light S.E. breeze and haze, at 1 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Prevailing
wind S.E, August and September.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silviin&aelig;</span>.&mdash;In March, two records of Robin at 93 (on 15th),
and (Turnberry) 109 on 14th, S.S.E. at latter station, and light
S.W. haze at former. Three other light records at 94 (Dhuheartach),
101 (Skervuile), and 102 (Rhinns of Islay) on 12th and
13th April, and one record of Whitethroats on 5th May at 114
(Little Ross).</p>

<p><i>In Autumn</i>, no great movement observed, and only single
records in August at 89 (Rona) on 1st, and at 90 (Kyleakin) on
25th, at 108 (Lamlash) on 23d, and Turnberry on 24th&mdash;the
latter returned as a "Garden Warbler," the others of Robins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phylloscopin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Gold-Crest&mdash;Mere indications only of a
spring movement, and that only at 114 (Little Ross), single records
on 12th, 15th, and 18th April. Wind easterly on first two
dates, but light W. on the last, with haze, when five Gold-Crests
rested on the lantern glass all night. In May, Wood Warblers
are returned at 114 on 20th and 21st, light S.E. and S., one
killed.</p>

<p>The autumn migration also extremely faintly marked. One
single record on 23d September, wind N.N.W., overcast, 9.35
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>; and two on 10th and 17th at 101 (Skervuile) and 114 respectively;
wind on 10th N.N.E., clear, and on 17th at 114
variable and hazy. All relate to Gold-Crests.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acrocephalin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;No records.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">- 102 -</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Tits&mdash;One Titmouse at 113 (Mull of Galloway) on
14th April; wind light, S.E.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Single record on 17th August at 113, wind
light, N.W., clear; one on 1st September at 109 (Turnberry), and
two at 113 on October 9th and 19th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troglodytid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Common Wren&mdash;A few single records in
April and May, about seven in all, at 93, 94, 109, and 114.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;One record in August 1st at 89 (Rona), one
record in September at 110 (Corsewall), and half a dozen or so in
October at five stations&mdash;102, 108, 109, 110, 113. Six seen at
noon on 23d; strong N". breeze and haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Wagtails&mdash;On 12th May two, at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, at 93
(Skerryvore), and five at 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> at 88 (Barra Head) ;-wind S.W.
at 93, and fresh W. at 88. The above the only spring records.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Two light records on 24th and 28th, both at 94
(Dhuheartach); north on first date, light S.S.E. on second date.
Two light records on 3d September at 113 (Mull of Galloway),
and on 4th at 93. Indication of general movement on 14th and
16th at 89 (Rona), 93, 94, 102, and 113. Two light records in
October 11th and 29th at 90 (Kyleakin), and 112 (Portpatrick).</p>

<p>Of Pipits, one record at 93 on 13th April; light, S.E., haze.
In autumn, two records only at 94 and 101, quite faint; wind,
light, east.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muscicapid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;No records of Flycatchers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hirundinid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>In Spring</i>, between 17th and 28th, five records
at 102 (six seen, light, S.W.), at 109 (two seen on 20th, light, S.,
rain), at 113, two on 21st, S., and fog, and two on 28th; and at
114, four, the first observed on the 17th April. In May, one at
93 on 26th, four at 108 (Lamlash) on the 9th, and six on the 11th.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;A few records in August&mdash;a flock on 17th at
110 (Corsewall), all day, and flocks on 31st at 113 (Mull of
Galloway), flying S.E. against E. breeze. Martins were also seen
at Barra Head. In September Swallows and Swifts (see <a href="#Cypselidae"><i>Cypselid&aelig;</i></a>)
at 90 (Kyleakin) on 15th, and Swallows at 94 on 1st, and
at 102 on 12th, 14th, and 16th&mdash;an appearance of a rush. Wind,
S. gale on 12th, S.W., and birds flying in a southerly direction.
In October, considerable evidence between 6th and 11th at 114.
The 11th the latest date of record.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fingillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>In Spring:</i> Sparrows and Finches noted

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;On 17th September, Sparrows at 113 in flocks,
and fifty "Rock Linnets" at 102 (Rhinns of Islay). (Probably
Twites, or possibly Redpoles.&mdash;J. A. H. B.). In October, a flock
of 200 "Rock Linnets" at 102 on 6th and 7th, and thousands
of "Grey Linnets" at 90 (Kyleakin); on 9th, Rock Linnets?
Grey Linnets? Evident rush of Linnets, accompanied at 101 by
a number of Tree Sparrows on 9th November. Rush lasted 7th,
8th, and 9th October, and another rush appears to have taken
place 4th at 102; 8th, at 90. Chaffinches, two only on 13th at
114. A few Grey Linnets at 90 on 25th December.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emberizid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Scarcely any indication at all. One record of
Snow Buntings on 6th October; two birds at 102, one in November
at 94 on 14th, and of Yellow Buntings at 114 on 10th. The
Snow Buntings are returned as "old birds resting on the rocks"
of 102. Wind in October at date of record, fresh S.W., and in
November strong N., at 94, and strong E., haze, at 114.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alaudid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Larks&mdash;A considerable spring migration, but
February records are possibly really belonging to past winter
movements. We give them here, however:&mdash;</p>

<p>15th, Larks at 90, 500 flying south, 9.40 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>; snow, calm.</p>

<p>13th, Larks at 93, two on lantern, 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>; fresh, S.E.</p>

<p>In March, on 7th, four Larks at 114, N. to S.W., clear. On
12th, a number at 93, and 12 at 94; and up to 15th, also at 109.
In April, a rush took place on 14th, and leading up to it from
the 12th at 93, 94, and 102; wind, light easterly. Again, large
numbers on 18th May at 86, and many remain till end of
August.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;A rush, but not very large, at 102 on 16th;
fewer on 17th September. A rush again on 17th October at 94,
and indications at 90, 94, 102, 109, 113 throughout October, and
up to 17th of November. Another rush at 94 on 11th November,
and small rush at 102 all forenoon on 16th. Stations 101,

S.W., haze; and at 98, 102, and 108, in addition to the above
stations in spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelicanid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring records less numerous than usual.
February, one at 101 on 8th; one at 101 on 27th March; two
at 108 on 1st and 4th April, and two at 94 on 14th April; May,
three records at 101&mdash;14th, 19th, and 29th; and June, four
records, all light, at 94, 101, and 114. Curiously, records of
Gannets or Solan Geese&mdash;as they are called&mdash;are seldom numerously
returned on this coast. [<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;We would be obliged to
our reporters at all the stations if, for next year, they would
give up one schedule entirely to Gannets or Solan Geese, and
enter daily observations of the species, including their numbers
seen, occupation, direction of flights and of wind, hours of
appearance and disappearance, etc.] In July a few itemed
under three dates&mdash;1st, 12th, and 16th to 20th. None in
August, September, October, or November, nor January 1886,
except one of hundreds at 102, fishing close to rocks, on
16th September, and the record of "Extra Nos." at 102
on 2d October, showing their daily appearance, though not
recorded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Herons: Few records, and none of any significance:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">- 106 -</span>
one in March on 1st at 114; one in October at 102, on 7th;
and one at 102 on 6th December.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anatid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Grey Geese [I wish I had heads of all the Geese
sent me] at 102 on 28th February; belongs, no doubt, to last
season. No more records of Geese till autumn: "Large Geese"?
September 17th, at 102; "Grey Geese," 10th October, at 102;
one "Goose" at 102 on November 11th. Odd records of
Barnacle Geese. <i>Eider Ducks.</i>&mdash;April 17th and 21st, at 94 and
102 respectively; also same place, 17th May, "3 [male], 3 [female] flying
west." Then in autumn, 25th and 26th September, at 94 and 102.</p>

<p>[After this the dates of arrival and departure will be desired,
whether they breed at the station or not, and if any unusual
numbers appear. Odd records occur, also, of Teal, Widgeon, and
Wild Duck, of little interest, but should, of course, always be
returned in schedules. "Swans" are noted at 86 (Monach Isles)
on 24th March 1885.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Columbid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Doves: May records at 90 (Rona) of Wood
Pigeons on 21st, and Rock Doves on 28th. <i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Only
two records in September and December, of twenty-five and
twenty respectively, in S.W. wind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gallin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;One pair Pheasants at 102 on 16th April, lighted
on the island at 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;an unusual occurrence. <i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;On
20th October, a Hen Pheasant at 102 again, shot, "rare;"
and again two Pheasants at 102, male and female, fresh E.
breeze, haze on island. (This looks like determined endeavour
to extend range.&mdash;J. A. H. B.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rallin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;21st May, at 88 (Barra Head), fresh N.E., cloudy;
23d May, at 102, "first heard," and one shot, light N. breeze,
clear; 24th, at 90 (Kyleakin), "first heard," 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, rain. <i>In
Autumn.</i>&mdash;One at 108 (Lamlash) on 24th October, fresh N.W.,
clear. One Water Rail on 13th November at 114; killed on
dome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charadriad&aelig;.</span>&mdash;August, one at 109 on 17th&mdash;Golden Plover.
Grey Plover (identified by wings, J. A. H. B.), at Dhuheartach
on 8th September. Very few records of G. Plovers, Oyster
Catchers, and most about September 17th at 94, 102, 109.</p>

<p>But Lapwings bulk largely in October and November.
Earliest, August 10th; latest, December 15th; rush if discernible:
100 on 20th October; "numbers" about 9th to 11th
November at 93, 94, 102, 113, 114.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">- 107 -</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scolopacid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;January 1885, one at 90 (Kyleakin), belongs
to 1884; one at 90 again on 17th February (?); none in
March (! ?); April, one on 15th at 94, light S.E. <i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;October
18th, one at 86, and one at 90; and one at 101 and one
at 102 on 9th November. <i>Curlews:</i> Many records as usual, but
Ave fear of little value as regards tracing migrations; and a few
records of Snipe and Jack Snipe. <i>Sandpipers:</i> Two records in
June and October at 101, and one in February, same place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Larid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Terns: "Terns" at 101 on 22d, 23d, and 24th May,
light S.W., clear, and variable. First seen at 114 on June
22d, S.W. breeze (see also under <a href="#Monach_Isles">Monach Isles</a> "Diary"). In
August, four records at 101 (Skervuile), between 16th and 22d,
light N. and N.E. <i>Gulls:</i> April, at 101 and 102, feeding on
herring-fry&mdash;Kittiwakes, "Gulls," etc. May, Skuas, "Boatswain
Birds," Black Headed Gull, on six dates at 93 and 101. Kittiwakes,
"Dirty Allans," and Herring Gulls, at 86, 94, and 101
respectively, on 17th, 21st, and 26th June respectively. In
July, at 101 and 108, Boatswain Birds, 1st to 14th; at 101, and
other scattered records. Ditto, at 101, in August 1st, 4th, and
6th, and 16th, 17th, and 19th and 21st, and a few other Gulls.
September, Kittiwakes at 101. In November, "Iceland Gulls"
at 94 on 6th and 16th; Boatswain Birds and others at 101.
Odd records in December.</p>

<p><i>Procellariid&aelig;.</i>&mdash;One record&mdash;one caught at 86 (Monach
Isles) on 5th September. One, "rare here," at 114 on 13th
November.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colymbid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;G. N. Divers occur every month except October
and December; at 101 in February, March, April, May, and
November; at 90 in March, August; at 86 on 5th September;
and in November at 89, 93, 94, 101, 102, 114. The above are
nearly all single records, or at most a pair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;"Tysties" at 101, 12th April, and Scarts; and the
former on 11th May at 101. Thousands at 102 of Puffins,
October 15th, 1885. Other records very light.</p>

<p>The best thanks of the Committee are due to the above-named
observers for their invaluable assistance, and for the faithful
manner in which they have filled in their schedules. To Mr
Henry Nicholas, Mr Robert Clyne, and Messrs Work and
Clague, we are in addition indebted for their kindness in sending
wings, etc., of the, to them, unknown species killed or
captured at their respective stations, by which means we have
been able to add not a little to the value and interest of the
returns. We trust their good example may be followed by
others. The trifling expenses incurred will be only too gladly
refunded in all cases. Our thanks are also due to Messrs
Macpherson and Duckworth, Messrs F. Reynolds, G. H. Caton-Haigh,
R. P. Harper, and H. Harbord, for their kind co-operation
in furnishing valuable independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">- 110 -</span> observations.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span></h3>

<p>The Report for the West Coast of England and Wales, and
the Isle of Man, refers to the movements during the spring and
autumn migrations of about one hundred species.</p>

<p>The spring immigration commenced on the 25th of March
with the advent of the Swallow at the Bahama Bank light-vessel,
and continued until the 15th of May, when "very
many" Swallows appeared between 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and 7 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> at Langness.
A noteworthy incident of the vernal immigration was the
great rush of Wheatears observed at the Bahama Bank vessel
and at Langness on the night of the 13th of April, when many
perished or were captured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">- 128 -</span></p>

<p>The spring emigration did not escape attention, for on the
night of the 20th of April the returning Fieldfares, Goldcrests,
etc., were observed at 11 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> at the Chickens Rock. Perhaps the
continuous movements of Thrushes and Blackbirds observed
throughout February, and especially between the 11th and 17th,
are referable to this class of migrants.</p>

<p>The autumn emigration, so far as our summer visitants are
concerned, may be said to have been initiated with the appearance
of the Cuckoo at Langness on the 25th of July, and was
prolonged until the 25th of October, when the last Swallow was
noted.</p>

<p>The first immigrant winter visitant from Northern Europe
was the Redwing, whose appearance at Carlisle was noted on
the 20th of September. The chief general movements which
usually characterise the southward autumnal passage were two
in number, and affected the stations along the entire coast from
the Isle of Man and the Eddystone. The first commenced on
the 16th of October, and continued until the 20th. The second
extended from the 8th to the 12th of November.</p>

<p>In connection with these general movements, which are so
often&mdash;indeed, we might say usually&mdash;participated in by a great
variety of species of very different orders seemingly seized by a
simultaneous migratory impulse, it would be, perhaps, well to
consult the meteorological record for an explanation of the
phenomenon. Mr J. A. Allen tells us that "birds discern
approaching meteorological changes," and that in the monthly
weather reports of the United States Signal Service Bureau reference
is often made to the movements of birds. "From these
reports it appears that the southward migration of Geese and
other Waterfowl usually precedes, often only by a few hours,
the approach of heavy storms, and a sudden and very great reduction
of temperature, which they often wholly avoid by keeping
in advance of the change." It would seem probable, too,
that birds await the approach of favourable meteorological conditions,
and then, having been detained by unfavourable conditions,
migrate <i>en masse</i>. Deeming that it would be interesting in
connection with the great movements during the autumn of 1885,
an examination of the weather reports issued by the Meteorological
Office has been made. The first of these, as we have seen,
commenced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">- 129 -</span> on the night of the 16th of October, and continued
until the night of the 20th. "The [weekly] Summary of
Changes in the Weather over the British Islands and their
Neighbourhood<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> from the 11th to the 17th of October informs
us that throughout this week the pressure over our islands and
their neighbourhood has been mainly cyclonic; from the 11th
to the 14th the type of gradient was northerly, but on the 15th
and 16th it was easterly. Two well-marked depressions appeared
in addition to the one which was passing away from us
on the morning of the 11th. The second of these depressions,
which had become a shallow subsidiary disturbance on the 15th
over the south of France, moved westward from our area during
the 16th; and as this system passed away, an anti-cyclonic
"col" was formed over our islands, uniting an anti-cyclone
over France with another off our extreme western coasts. With
this anti-cyclone the cold northerly winds which had prevailed
changed, and on the 16th the weather became very fine over
England, the temperature rose, and the wind became a southeasterly
breeze. The summary for the 18th to the 24th of
October informs us that "the distribution of pressure over our
islands and France was anti-cyclonic, with light or moderate
south-easterly and easterly winds, till the 20th, then cyclonic
and complex, with northerly winds."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> These reports and summaries refer not only to the British Islands, but to
North-Western Europe, from Bodo and Haparanda to Corunna and Toulon.
They are based upon numerous Continental returns from the area indicated, as
well as from all parts of our own islands.</p>

</div>

<p>The second movement extended from the 8th to the 12th of
November. Regarding the meteorological conditions, the summaries
tell us that previous to the 8th the weather had been
changeable and unsettled generally, and the distribution of
pressure mainly cyclonic, with westerly, north-westerly, and
southerly winds. From the 8th to 13th the pressure system
over North-Western Europe was anti-cyclonic, with light
(easterly in south, south-easterly in west, and southerly in the
north) breezes. On the 13th, however, a large and somewhat
deep depression advanced from the Atlantic, and spread quickly
over all North-Western Europe, with gradients for south-westerly
and westerly winds.</p>

<p>Thus we had the two chief movements of the autumn ushered
in by and concurrent with anti-cyclonic conditions, preceded by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">- 130 -</span>
and ceasing with cyclonic depressions. These great barometric
changes are also frequently accompanied by equally great
changes in temperature, and this may be the cause of the
mists which so commonly prevail on "a migration night."</p>

<p>It would be well if a summary of all the sections of the reports
could be submitted to a competent meteorologist. This,
it is thought, would result in a few years in establishing a better
understanding of the relationship which exists between the
weather and the great movements of birds.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that the southerly flow of autumn migrants
is evenly distributed along the entire west coast of England,
though such appears to be commonly the case on the east coast.
On the contrary, the schedules again afford unmistakable evidence
that the great majority of these migrants are observed
at stations south of Anglesey. But while the north-west section
of the coast is thus less favoured than the rest, such is not
the case with the Isle of Man, which comes in for an important
share of the west coast migratory movements. Now, since it
is a well-established fact that large masses of migrants from
Northern Europe, along with others from the Far&ouml;es, Iceland,
and Greenland, pass down the west coast of Scotland, whence
many cross to Ireland, it seems probable, from the evidence
borne by the English West Coast returns, that the majority of
the remainder leave Scotland at some point on the Wigtown
coast, and pass to the west coast of Wales by way of the Isle of
Man, and thus avoid the English shores of the Irish Sea.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Whether this is a reasonable and likely explanation, or not, the
fact remains that the schedules for the years 1884 and 1885<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
received from the coasts of Flint, Cheshire, Lancashire, and
Cumberland&mdash;and they are among the most faithfully kept&mdash;make
it evident that during those seasons comparatively few of
the ordinary migrants were observed there, and that the great
general movements did not affect them in any considerable
degree.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> The remarks do not apply to migrants among the <i>Limicol&aelig;</i> and <i>Anseres</i>,
which, as a rule, religiously follow coast lines, and which are abundantly represented
on the Solway and coasts of Cumberland and Lancashire.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> The scarcity or entire absence of migratory birds at St Bees is remarked upon
ill the Reports for 1880 and 1881.</p>

<p>The migratory movements of such partially resident species<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">- 131 -</span>
as the Redbreast, Hedge Sparrow, Wren, Greenfinch, Sparrow,
Bullfinch, Yellow Hammer, and others are recorded.</p>

<p>Of the rarer and more interesting species included in the
Report, the Black Redstart, White Wagtail, Gadwall, Red-Necked
and Grey Phalaropes, Ruff, Black Tern, Glaucus Gull,
and Leach's Petrel may be mentioned.</p>

<p>As an unusual species to observe at the lantern, we may
allude to the occurrence of the Moorhen (<i>Gallinula chloropus</i>)
at the South Bishop, a locality indicating that the bird must
have been migrating.</p>

<p>The scarcity of the Woodcock, Goldcrest, and Short-Eared
Owl is worthy of note. This is the more remarkable in the case
of the Woodcock, since it occurred in almost unprecedented
numbers on the east coast of England.</p>

<p>The number of light stations returning schedules was only
one less than in 1885, although four schedules less were sent out.</p>

<p>There was no light shown at the Tuskar Rock&mdash;the best Irish
station&mdash;between from June 1st to November 20th, but since
that date a more powerful light has been exhibited.</p>

<p>The great importance of forwarding a leg and wing of at least
one specimen of each species killed, cannot be too strongly impressed
upon on the light-keepers. Unless the birds are correctly
identified, the value of this inquiry is materially
diminished, and ornithologists may refuse to accept the statements
of the observers.</p>

<p>In the schedules sent out in the spring of 1886, the request
to forward the legs and wings of birds was conspicuously printed
on the top of each schedule. Mr Edward M'Carron, who had
already proved himself a most intelligent observer at the Tearaght
Rock (removed to Mine Head in the autumn), has been
the largest contributor of specimens, and his careful notes prove
the interest taken in this inquiry.</p>

<p>Anticipatory of the report for the spring of 1886, it may be
mentioned that several rare species have occurred, which would
probably have passed under another name, were it not for the
distribution of six copies of "Morris's British Birds," with
coloured plates, and the production of specimens. We trust the
Commissioners of Irish Lights will distribute six additional
copies of Morris in the present year. We believe these volumes
are greatly appreciated, and that in placing them in their annual
list of books to be purchased for the light-keepers, a wise selection
has been made.</p>

<p>No specimen of the Greenland Falcon or Snowy Owl was
observed in 1885. The former species cannot, therefore, be regarded
as a more than an accidental winter visitor to the West
Coast; and only one specimen of the Snowy Owl was recorded
since these observations were commenced. Thrushes, including
probably Redwings, were noted in considerable numbers about
the lights, over a range of sixty miles on the Wexford and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">- 133 -</span>
Wicklow coasts, between the 11th and 15th February. There
was no hard frost at the time. These lights are all seven to ten
miles from shore. During the second week in April, at several
stations. Thrushes are recorded. The great autumn rush took
place between the 6th and 10th November, and a smaller one
between the 17th and 20th October. Blackbirds accompanied
the Thrushes, but in smaller numbers.</p>

<p>"A Blackbird with a white breast" was observed at Mine
Head from the 8th to the 10th December. A further description
given of this bird shows it may have been a Ring Ouzel.
The Hedge Sparrow seems to be resident in small numbers during
the winter on the Tearaght Rock, nine miles off the Kerry
coast, and possibly it breeds there. No clear indication of the
migration of the Robin has yet been shown on the Irish Coast.
The records of its occurrence are few and scattered. The Black
Redstart was recorded at several stations in the southern half of
Ireland; specimens were forwarded from Mine Head, the Skelligs,
and Rockabill. It is apparently a regular winter visitor to the
Skelligs and Tearaght, generally appearing in October and
November. With one exception (in February) there is no record
of its occurrence during any other month. The autumn migration
of the Goldcrest was the smallest yet recorded, but on the
12th and 13th April a spring movement was apparent. As usual,
the Starling is the best marked migrant, occurring at almost
every station. There is no record yet of the Chough having
been seen on the east coast by the light-keepers. The Magpie is
apparently not a migratory bird in Ireland. The observations
on the Cuckoo and Corncrake are few, when it is remembered
they are well-known and regular visitors. There is, so far, no
record of the Cuckoo having struck the lanterns, and but one
instance of the Corncrake so doing. It has been stated as an
"undoubted fact" (Yarrell, 4th ed., vol. iii., p. 324), by Mr
Howard Saunders, that the Woodcock often makes its appearance
on the south and west coasts of Ireland before it is noticed
in the north and east. The light-keepers' schedules do not
contradict this statement; but their observations are not yet
sufficiently numerous to confirm it beyond a doubt. The northward
movement of the Whimbrel (May Bird or young Curlew)
has been well marked every year. On the return journey they
are either confounded with the Curlew, or if they take the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">- 134 -</span>
route, they may travel at a higher level without whistling, and
thus escape the notice of the light-keepers. The schedules from
the Skelligs and Tearaght have always a special interest, these
rocks being the greatest breeding-places of sea birds on the
Irish Coast. Mr M'Carron estimates the number of Stormy
Petrels on the Tearaght in July at six or seven thousand. The
changes of plumage in the Razorbill has been the source of much
comment by Mr M'Carron. The sudden and almost complete
disappearance of the so-called "Black-billed Auk," and the reappearance
of the Razorbill in breeding plumage in a short
interval, show that when the old birds arrive to breed, the young
birds of the previous year leave the neighbourhood of the
Tearaght, and probably go out to sea.</p>

<p>A young bird, 8 inches long, and still carrying a few whitish
downy feathers at the back of the neck, sent up by Mr M'Carron,
and obtained on August 1st, has the chin and throat <i>black</i>. An
older bird, killed on January 13th, has the chin and throat
white. In Yarrell, vol. iv., p. 60, the chin and throat of a bird
a week old is said to be <i>white</i>; and Seebohm says the young in
down have the underparts <i>greyish white</i>.</p>

<p>In the report for 1884, it is stated that no Gannets perched on
the Little Skellig after October 20th, and in the present report
February 28th is given as the date of their reappearance on this
well-known Irish breeding station.</p>

<p>The most interesting stations are those on small islands or
rocks, or light-vessels at a considerable distance from shore; and
the regular occurrence of so many land birds of apparently weak
powers of flight around these lanterns is a matter of surprise to
those unacquainted with the facts of migration.</p>

<p>We believe this inquiry has contributed not a little to enlighten
the general public as to the movements of birds, some of
which were partially known to ornithologists, and others suspected;
but the accumulated data of the observers (making all
reasonable allowances for errors in identification), are sufficient
to satisfy the most sceptical of the powers of flight and endurance
possessed by many small birds, and the wide range of the
migratory impulse.</p>

<p>An effort has been made this year to shorten the Irish report,
but the number of birds which strike the lights is comparatively
small, compared with the large numbers arriving on the coasts of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">- 135 -</span>
Great Britain. It is therefore all the more necessary to give the
records in detail, in order to arrive at any general and trust-worthy
conclusion.</p>

<p>To the Commissioners of Irish Lights, to the secretary, Mr
Owen Armstrong; and to Captain Boxer, R.N., we continue to
be under many obligations. It is, however, to the light-keepers
themselves we are most indebted, since they have gratuitously
placed at our disposal much of their leisure, and evinced an
interest in this inquiry which could scarcely have been anticipated.
Some of their names must be specially mentioned in
connection with the occurrence of rare birds in the report for
1886, which promises to be an interesting one.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">General Remarks of Light-Keepers.</span></h3>

<p><i>Galley Head.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Autumn:</span> No birds were killed striking the
lantern during the two years I have been at this station.&mdash;John
Kelly.</p>

<p><i>Mine Head.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Autumn:</span> A pair of Ravens and Peregrine
Falcons, and several pairs of Choughs, breed in the cliffs close
to the lighthouse. A large number of Cormorants also build
here, and Gulls on several islets close to the shore.&mdash;Hugh J.
Dugan.</p>

<p><i>Tuskar Rock.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Autumn:</span> There was no light shown in lighthouse
from June 1st to November 20th, which accounts for the
apparent scarcity of some migrants at this station.&mdash;Richard
Hamilton.</p>

<p><i>Arklow South Light-ship.</i>&mdash;On the night of November 9th,
several birds of various kinds about lantern; many killed; some
fell on deck, and a large number overboard.&mdash;Patrick Clancy.</p>

<p><i>Arklow North Light-ship.</i>&mdash;May 3d, large flocks of land-birds
about lantern at night.&mdash;William Daly.</p>

<p><i>South Maidens.</i>&mdash;In January and February few birds seen,
except Seapies, Gulls, and Shearwaters. From June 21st to
16th July no birds save Gannets, Gulls, and Seapies.&mdash;M. Barry.</p>

<p><i>Innishtrahull.</i>&mdash;I have only observed birds about the lantern
on dark nights, and in thick misty weather.&mdash;R. Phelan.</p>

<p><i>Lough Swilly.</i>&mdash;Birds are scarce here&mdash;not a single one has
struck lantern since I came.&mdash;James Keenan.</p>

<p><i>Killybegs.</i>&mdash;Seagulls and Curlews are here all the year. Lapwing's
nest close by. Cormorants and Pigeons breed in cliff's.&mdash;J. Hill.</p>

<p><i>Eagle Island, E.</i>&mdash;Gulls were scarce, and Gannets, "Sea
Parrots, and Puffins" were only to be seen in flight, which was
invariably to the west&mdash;the Gannets in a long extended line,
singly or in pairs, and the Sea Parrots in flocks of twenty to fifty,
flying low. There are two Titlarks, two Wrens, and about ten
Sandlarks on island at present (1st January 1886). A few of
the last-named breed here, also the Titlarks, and possibly the
Wrens, as there are some old walls into which I have seen them
hop for shelter; but I Have never noticed them in spring or
summer.&mdash;Daniel Hawkins.</p>

<p><i>Clare Island.</i>&mdash;The sea-birds (Gulls, Puffins, Guillemots, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">- 139 -</span>
Cormorants) continued to arrive from 1st of April to 1st of June
to breed. They were not as numerous as last year. All left
before August 15th, except the Cormorants and a few Royal
Gulls. Eagles always remain on island.&mdash;G. H. Brownell.</p>

<p><i>Slyne Head, North.</i>&mdash;The number of sea-birds is chiefly regulated
by the feeding. There is a greater number for the past
two months (June and July) than has been the case for the past
five years.&mdash;Robert Tyrell.</p>

<p><i>Arran Island, N.</i>&mdash;Puffins, Gulls, Gannets, Curlew, Seapie,
Cormorants, and Sandlarks come and go according to the state
of the sea&mdash;if wild, none, and <i>vice versa</i>.&mdash;Thomas Fortune.</p>

<p><i>Straw Island.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Spring:</span> The number of birds were few during
the spring. The Lark, Hedge Sparrow, Robin, Wagtail, and
Linnet are remarkable for their total absence this year, though
numerous in the springs of 1883 and 1884. <span class="smcap">Autumn:</span> A great
scarcity of sea-birds of all kinds, especially the Gannet.
Land-birds&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, "Crows," Rooks, Larks, Starlings,
Thrushes&mdash;plentiful, especially young Starlings, Thrushes, and Blackbirds.
From 13th November to 17th November they came in rushes
during severe weather.&mdash;Charles Boyle.</p>

<p><i>Tearaght.</i>&mdash;Birds remaining September 1st, Choughs, Hooded
Crows, Wheatear, Wrens, Rock Pipit, Peregrine, Kittiwake (old

and Oyster-Catcher.&mdash;Edward M'Carron.</p>

<p><i>Skelligs.</i>&mdash;In February, Gannets, Cormorants, Kittiwakes
(mostly young). Herring Gulls, a few Black-Backed do., and
flocks of "the Black-Billed Auk (young Razorbill&mdash;R. M. B.)
fishing round rock.&mdash;Thomas Kerley.</p>

prey on the eggs of other birds, and carry them off in their bill
without breaking them&mdash;Guillemots' eggs, some of which weigh
eight ounces. They also carry off the young birds and devour
them on a rock close by. On May 17th I saw one seize an old
Razorbill, which was on a ledge with others, and carry it about
100 yards, when it fell into the sea. The "Mottled Gull,"
which I suppose is the young Herring Gull, was not seen since
the 1st of May. They were seen again on August 5th, and will

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
